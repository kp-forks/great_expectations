title: Result format
---


You can use the `result_format` parameter to define the level of detail for Validation Results in your Data Docs. For example, you can return a success or failure message, a summary of observed values, a list of failing values, or you can add a query or a filter function that returns all failing rows. Typical use cases for this parameter include cleaning data and excluding Validation Result data in published Data Docs.

The `result_format` parameter can be a string or a dictionary which specifies the fields to return in `result`. 

The string values `"BOOLEAN_ONLY"`, `"BASIC"`, `"SUMMARY"`, and `"COMPLETE"` are supported. The default is `"SUMMARY"`. The behavior of each setting is described in [examples](#examples).

When using a dictionary, `result_format` can include the following keys:

- `result_format`: Sets the fields to return in results.

- `unexpected_index_column_names`: Defines the columns that can be used to identify unexpected results. For example, primary key (PK) column(s) or other columns with unique identifiers. Supports multiple column names as a list.

- `return_unexpected_index_query`: When running validations, a query (or a set of indices) is returned that allows you to retrieve the full set of unexpected results including any columns identified in `unexpected_index_column_names`.  Setting this value to `False` suppresses the output (default is `True`).

- `partial_unexpected_count`: Sets the number of results to include in `partial_unexpected_count``, if applicable. Set the value to zero to suppress the unexpected counts.

- `exclude_unexpected_values`: When running validations, a set of unexpected results' indices and values is returned.  Setting this value to `True` suppresses values from the output to only have indices (default is `False`).

- `include_unexpected_rows`: When running validations, this returns the entire row for each unexpected value in dictionary form. When using `include_unexpected_rows`, you must explicitly specify `result_format` and `result_format` must be more verbose than `BOOLEAN_ONLY`.

:::note Note
`include_unexpected_rows` returns EVERY row for each unexpected value. In large tables, this could result in an unmanageable amount of data.

## Configure result format

You can specify `result_format` for a single Expectation, or an entire Checkpoint. When configured at the Expectation-level, 
the configuration is not persisted, and you'll receive a `UserWarning`. GX recommends that you use an Expectation-level configuration for exploratory analysis, and add the final configuration at the Checkpoint-level.

### Expectation-level configuration

To apply `result_format` to an Expectation, you pass it into the Expectation configuration on your Validator:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_complete_example_set"
```

### Checkpoint-level configuration

Run the following code to apply `result_format` to every Expectation in a Suite:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format.py result_format_checkpoint_example"
```
Your Checkpoint configuration is defined below the `runtime_configuration` key. 

The results are stored in the Validation Result after running the Checkpoint.

:::note Note
The `unexpected_index_list`, as represented by primary key (PK) columns, is 
rendered in Data Docs when `COMPLETE` is selected. 

The `unexpected_index_query`, which for `SQL` and `Spark` is a query that allows you to retrieve the full set of unexpected values from the dataset, is also rendered by default when `COMPLETE` is selected. For `Pandas`, this parameter returns the full set of unexpected indices, which can also be used to retrieve the full set of unexpected values. This is returned
whether the `unexpected_index_column_names` are defined. 

To suppress this output, set the `return_unexpected_index_query` parameter to `False`. 

Regardless of how Result Format is configured, `unexpected_list` is never rendered in Data Docs.

## Examples

The following examples use the data defined in the following Pandas DataFrame:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format pandas_df_for_result_format"
```

### Behavior for `BOOLEAN_ONLY`

When the `result_format` is `BOOLEAN_ONLY`, no `result` is returned. The result of evaluating the Expectation is exclusively returned via the value of the `success` parameter.

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_boolean_example"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_boolean_example_output"
```

### Behavior for `BASIC`

For `BASIC` format, a `result` is generated with a basic justification for why an Expectation failed or succeeded. The format is intended for quick feedback and it works well in Jupyter Notebooks.

GX has standard behavior for describing the results of `column_map_expectation` and `ColumnAggregateExpectation` Expectations.

`column_map_expectation` applies a boolean test function to each element within a column, and so returns a list of unexpected values to justify the Expectation result.

The basic `result` includes:

```python
{
    "success" : Boolean,
    "result" : {
        "partial_unexpected_list" : [A list of up to 20 values that violate the Expectation]
        "unexpected_count" : The total count of unexpected values in the column
        "unexpected_percent" : The overall percent of unexpected values
        "unexpected_percent_nonmissing" : The percent of unexpected values, excluding missing values from the denominator
    }
}
```

**Note:** When unexpected values are duplicated, `unexpected_list` contains multiple copies of the value.

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_basic_example_set"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_basic_example_set_output"
```

`ColumnAggregateExpectation` computes a single aggregate value for the column, and so returns a single 
`observed_value` to justify the Expectation result.

The basic `result` includes:

```python
{
    "success" : Boolean,
    "result" : {
        "observed_value" : The aggregate statistic computed for the column
    }
}
```

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_basic_example_agg"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_basic_example_agg_output"
```

### Behavior for `SUMMARY`

A `result` is generated with a summary justification for why an Expectation was successful or unsuccessful. The format is intended for more detailed exploratory work and includes additional information beyond what is included by `BASIC`. For example, it can support generating dashboard results of whether a set of Expectations are being met.

GX has standard behavior for support for describing the results of `column_map_expectation` and `ColumnAggregateExpectation` Expectations.

`column_map_expectation` applies a boolean test function to each element within a column, and so returns a list of unexpected values to justify the Expectation result.

The summary `result` includes:

```python
{
    'success': False,
    'result': {
        'element_count': The total number of values in the column
        'unexpected_count': The total count of unexpected values in the column (also in `BASIC`)
        'unexpected_percent': The overall percent of unexpected values (also in `BASIC`)
        'unexpected_percent_nonmissing': The percent of unexpected values, excluding missing values from the denominator (also in `BASIC`)
        "partial_unexpected_list" : [A list of up to 20 values that violate the Expectation] (also in `BASIC`)
        'missing_count': The number of missing values in the column
        'missing_percent': The total percent of missing values in the column
        'partial_unexpected_counts': [{A list of objects with value and counts, showing the number of times each of the unexpected values occurs}
        'partial_unexpected_index_list': [A list of up to 20 of the indices of the unexpected values in the column, as defined by the columns in `unexpected_index_column_names`]
    }
}
```

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_summary_example_set"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_summary_example_set_output"
```

`ColumnAggregateExpectation` computes a single aggregate value for the column, and so returns a `observed_value` to justify the Expectation result. It also includes additional information regarding observed values and counts, depending on the specific Expectation.

The summary `result` includes:

```python
{
    'success': False,
    'result': {
        'observed_value': The aggregate statistic computed for the column (also in `BASIC`)
    }
}
```

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_summary_example_agg"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_summary_example_agg_output"
```


### Behavior for `COMPLETE`

A `result` is generated with all available justification for why an Expectation was successful or unsuccessful. The format is intended for debugging pipelines or developing detailed regression tests.

Great Expectations implements standard behaviors to support describing the results of `column_map_expectation` and `ColumnAggregateExpectation` Expectations.

`column_map_expectation` applies a boolean test function to each element within a column, and so returns a list of unexpected values to justify the Expectation result.

The complete `result` includes:

```python
{
    'success': False,
    'result': {
        "unexpected_list" : [A list of all values that violate the Expectation]
        'unexpected_index_list': [A list of the indices of the unexpected values in the column, as defined by the columns in `unexpected_index_column_names`]
        'unexpected_index_query': [A query that can be used to retrieve all unexpected values (SQL and Spark), or the full list of unexpected indices (Pandas)]
        'element_count': The total number of values in the column (also in `SUMMARY`)
        'unexpected_count': The total count of unexpected values in the column (also in `SUMMARY`)
        'unexpected_percent': The overall percent of unexpected values (also in `SUMMARY`)
        'unexpected_percent_nonmissing': The percent of unexpected values, excluding missing values from the denominator (also in `SUMMARY`)
        'missing_count': The number of missing values in the column  (also in `SUMMARY`)
        'missing_percent': The total percent of missing values in the column  (also in `SUMMARY`)
    }
}
```

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_complete_example_set"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_complete_example_set_output
```

`ColumnAggregateExpectation` computes a single aggregate value for the column, and so returns a `observed_value` to justify the Expectation result. It also includes additional information regarding observed values and counts, depending on the specific Expectation.

The complete `result` includes:

```python
{
    'success': False,
    'result': {
        'observed_value': The aggregate statistic computed for the column (also in `SUMMARY`)
        'details': {<Expectation-specific result justification fields, which may be more detailed than in `SUMMARY`>}
    }
}
```

For example:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_complete_example_agg"
```

Returns the following output:

```python title="Python" name="docs/docusaurus/docs/snippets/result_format result_format_complete_example_agg_output"
```
