## How to effectively get support

The following are some recommendations for resolving issues on your own. Resolving issues on your own builds your knowledge and allows you to share that knowledge with the community.

### Search the GX documentation

Search the docs you're using currently for an answer to your issue or question.

If you're new to GX Cloud, review [About GX Cloud](/cloud/about_gx.md).

If you're new to GX OSS, try the [Quickstart](/oss/tutorials/quickstart.md) or one of the specific getting started guides such as [Get started with Great Expectations and Databricks](/oss/tutorials/getting_started/how_to_use_great_expectations_in_databricks.md) or [Get started with Great Expectations and SQL](/oss/get_started/get_started_with_gx_and_sql.md).

### Include all the relevant information

Clearly explain the issue you're experiencing, or the problem you're trying to solve. When asking questions, you should provide the following:

- The complete error log or logs.

- The relevant code you're trying to run.

- The version of GX OSS you're using.

- A detailed explanation of what you're trying to resolve including what attempts you've made on your own to date.
