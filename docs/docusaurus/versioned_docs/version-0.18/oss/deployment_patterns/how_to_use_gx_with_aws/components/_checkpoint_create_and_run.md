import TechnicalTag from '../../../../reference/learn/term_tags/_tag.mdx';

To validate and run post-validation <TechnicalTag tag="action" text="Actions" />, you create and store a <TechnicalTag tag="checkpoint" text="Checkpoint"/> for your Batch.

Checkpoints can be preconfigured with a Batch Request and Expectation Suite, or they can take them in as parameters at runtime. They can also execute numerous Actions based on the Validation Results that are returned when Checkpoint runs.

:::tip Tip

To preconfigure a Checkpoint with a Batch Request and Expectation Suite, see [Manage Checkpoints](/oss/guides/validation/checkpoints/checkpoint_lp.md)
