Airflow is a data orchestration tool for creating and maintaining data pipelines through DAGs written in Python. DAGs complete work through operators, which are templates that encapsulate a specific type of work.

:::info Info

Consult Astronomer's [Orchestrate Great Expectations with Airflow](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-great-expectations) guide for more information on how to set up and configure the `GreatExpectationsOperator` in an Airflow DAG.

For more information about implementing and using Airflow, see [Astronomer's documentation](https://docs.astronomer.io/).
