After you have confirmed that Python 3 is installed locally, you can create a virtual environment with `venv` before installing your packages with `pip`. The following examples use `venv` for virtual environments because it is included with Python 3. You can use alternate tools such as virtualenv and pyenv to install GX in virtual environments.

Run one of the following code blocks to create your virtual environment:

```console title="Terminal command"
python -m venv my_venv
```

or

```console title="Terminal command"
python3 -m venv my_venv
```

A new directory named `my_venv` is created in your virtual environment. 

Run the following code to activate the virtual environment:

```console title="Terminal command"
source my_venv/bin/activate
```

:::tip Tip
To change the name of your virtual environment, replace `my_venv` in the example code.
