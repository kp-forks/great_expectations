Now that you have verified that you have a valid configuration you can add your new Data Source to your Data Context with the command:

```python title="Python" name="add your datasource to your data_context"
```

:::caution Caution

If the value of `datasource_config["name"]` corresponds to a Data Source that is already defined in your Data Context, then using the above command will overwrite the existing Data Source.

:::

:::tip Tip

If you want to ensure that you only add a Data Source when it won't overwrite an existing one, you can use the following code instead:

```python title="Python" name="add your datasource to your data_context only if it does not already exit"
```
