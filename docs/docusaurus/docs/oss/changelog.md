### Deprecation policy

GX Core follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200), including its [guidelines for deprecation](https://semver.org/#how-should-i-handle-deprecating-functionality).

When we deprecate public functionality, we will

- update our documentation to let you know about the change.
- issue a new minor release with the deprecation in place.

Before we completely remove the functionality in a new major release, there will be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so that you can smoothly transition.

### 1.23.2 (2026-09-25)

Compatibility: `sqlalchemy` now `<2.1` (extras `snowflake`, `databricks`)

#### Highlights

- **Fixes GX on SQLAlchemy 2.1** — SQLAlchemy 2.1.0, released 2026-09-24, broke GX 1.23.1 and earlier on Python 3.11+, where every SQL extra resolves it by default. Depending on the backend, `import great_expectations` failed whenever snowflake-sqlalchemy was installed, every Databricks query failed, driverless `postgresql://` URLs could not load a driver, BigQuery queries comparing against a float failed, SQL Server reported mixed-case and upper-case tables as missing, and `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type(type_="Numeric")` failed on float columns. 1.23.2 fixes all of these: the `snowflake` and `databricks` extras stay below SQLAlchemy 2.1 until their dialects support it, and every other SQL extra runs on 2.1. Python 3.10 is unaffected, since SQLAlchemy 2.1 requires Python 3.11. If you can't upgrade yet, pin `sqlalchemy<2.1`; do the same if you install snowflake-sqlalchemy or databricks-sqlalchemy outside GX's extras. ([#12269](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12269))

  ```python
  pip install --upgrade 'great_expectations[snowflake]'  # include your extras so the SQLAlchemy cap applies
  ```

- **Regex Expectations work on ClickHouse** — The four regex Expectations now run on ClickHouse, which does not support `regexp_like()`. ClickHouse is covered by integration tests for these Expectations. ([#12222](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12222))

  ```python
  gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegex(column="name", regex="^A")
  ```

- **Correct substring matching for regex Expectations on Snowflake** — Snowflake's `REGEXP` operator anchors patterns to the whole value, so unanchored patterns behaved differently there than on other backends. Regex Expectations on Snowflake now use substring semantics that match every other GX backend, while preserving the user's pattern. ([#12221](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12221))

  ```python
  gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegex(column="name", regex="ell")
  ```

- **Nested struct columns supported in Spark value-counts Expectations** — On the Spark engine, Expectations that rely on the `column.value_counts` metric — including `ExpectColumnMostCommonValueToBeInSet` and `ExpectColumnKLDivergenceToBeLessThan` — now work for dotted nested struct paths such as `address.city`, instead of returning an empty result with an unresolved-column error. ([#12231](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12231))

  ```python
  gx.expectations.ExpectColumnMostCommonValueToBeInSet(column="address.city", value_set=["Springfield"])
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- GX works on SQLAlchemy 2.1, which broke 1.23.1 on several backends: the `snowflake` and `databricks` extras are capped below 2.1, a broken snowflake-sqlalchemy install no longer prevents `import great_expectations`, driverless `postgresql://` URLs fall back to psycopg2 when psycopg is unavailable, BigQuery renders `Double` as `FLOAT64`, SQL Server reflects mixed-case tables, the `Numeric` type name matches float columns again, and database URL masking keeps the database and query string verbatim. ([#12269](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12269))
- Validation results containing an infinite `Decimal` value — for example the maximum, mean or sum of a PostgreSQL `numeric` column or a pandas column of `Decimal` values — now serialize as float infinity instead of raising `decimal.InvalidOperation`. ([#12254](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12254))
- Regex Expectations on Snowflake now match substrings, consistent with other backends, rather than requiring the pattern to match the entire column value. ([#12221](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12221))
- `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` no longer misreads a query as containing a JOIN when the letters appear inside a string literal, a column name such as `join_date`, a quoted identifier or a comment; such queries are aliased correctly again and no longer fail with a syntax error on MySQL and SQL Server. ([#12249](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12249))
- Building validators on multiple threads no longer serializes or deadlocks on Python 3.10 and 3.11: concurrent validator construction now proceeds independently per instance while still building each validator only once. ([#12232](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12232))
- Regex Expectations now work on ClickHouse, which lacks `regexp_like()`; other SQL dialects are unchanged. ([#12222](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12222))
- Type Expectations on ClickHouse now compare and report the underlying SQL type for nullable columns instead of the `Nullable(T)` wrapper, so `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` and `ExpectColumnValuesToBeInTypeList` behave as expected. ([#12219](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12219))
- The Spark `column.value_counts` metric now resolves nested struct columns such as `address.city`, so Expectations built on it return results instead of an unresolved-column error. ([#12231](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12231))

##### Docs

- The changelog entries for releases 1.0.0 through 1.17.0 are rewritten in the structured format, and the previously missing 1.13.1 release now has its own entry. ([#12227](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12227))
- The changelog entries for releases 1.17.1 through 1.23.0 are rewritten in the structured format, and the deprecation timeline gains rows for the `gx-redshift` extra alias and for `CloudDataContext` / cloud mode of `get_context`. ([#12225](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12225))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Redshift CI jobs are capped to three concurrent runs against the shared cluster, and test teardown now drops every test schema with retries so failed runs no longer leak schemas. No user-visible change. ([#12257](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12257))

### 1.23.1 (2026-09-18)

**Known issue:** on Python 3.11+, this release resolves SQLAlchemy 2.1 (released 2026-09-24), which it does not support. Upgrade to 1.23.2, or pin `sqlalchemy<2.1`.

#### Highlights

- **Spark now evaluates each regex independently with match_on="all"** — On Spark, ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegexList with match_on="all" now checks every regex separately against each column value, so patterns anchored at different positions (such as ^A and [0-9]\{3}$) both match a value that satisfies them. This matches the behavior already seen on Pandas and SQL. ([#12198](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12198))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegexList(
      column="id",
      regex_list=["^A", "[0-9]{3}$"],
      match_on="all",
  )
  ```

- **Each Validator reports results for its own Batch when a datasource is reused** — Validators built on the same datasource no longer borrow one another's Batch. Running two validation definitions on threads, or creating two validators from one datasource on a single thread, now evaluates and reports each validator's own data, with the correct batch_id, batch_spec and batch_definition on the result. This fixes a long-standing latent bug made reachable by [#12148](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12148) in the 1.23.0 release. ([#12211](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12211))

  ```python
  validator_a = context.get_validator(batch_request=request_a)
  validator_b = context.get_validator(batch_request=request_b)
  # validator_a still validates request_a's batch
  result = validator_a.expect_table_row_count_to_equal(value=3)
  ```

- **A Spark schema saved in great_expectations.yml reloads correctly** — A persisted spark_schema is now read back through StructType.fromJson, so reopening a File Data Context round-trips the schema instead of failing inside PySpark. Values that are not an accepted schema form now raise a validation error naming the field and the accepted types. ([#12200](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12200))

  ```python
  context = gx.get_context(mode="file")
  asset = context.data_sources.get("spark_ds").get_asset("my_asset")
  assert asset.spark_schema is not None
  ```

- **GX config files are read and written as UTF-8 regardless of locale** — config_variables.yml and great_expectations.yml, and the .gitignore read while scaffolding a project, are now opened with an explicit UTF-8 encoding. Projects containing non-ASCII values or comments can be created and reloaded on hosts with a non-UTF-8 locale, and a project YAML file that is not valid UTF-8 now raises an error naming the file instead of a bare decode error. ([#12182](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12182), [#12204](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12204))

- **A gallery-wide test tier for data sources** — A new gallery support tier asserts a measured test result across the entire shipped expectation library — one case per registered expectation, each pairing a passing and a failing configuration — and nine data sources (pandas in-memory and filesystem CSV, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Trino, BigQuery, Databricks and Redshift) now declare it after being measured against the full gallery. ([#12150](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12150))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Adds a gallery support tier that asserts a passing test result over the whole shipped expectation library, with nine data sources declaring it, a required CI lane per member, membership and coverage guards, and a measurement mode for evaluating new candidate backends. ([#12150](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12150))

##### Bug fixes

- ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegexList with match_on="all" on Spark now evaluates each regex independently, so patterns anchored at different positions no longer fail on values that satisfy them all. ([#12198](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12198))
- A Validator now keeps the identity of the Batches it loaded even when its execution engine is shared, so concurrent validations and multiple validators on one datasource each evaluate and report their own Batch; a configuration naming a batch the engine does not hold now raises instead of silently validating the most recently loaded batch. ([#12211](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12211))
- The remaining config file reads and writes in the serializable data context are pinned to UTF-8, so scaffolding a project with a non-ASCII .gitignore and reading or updating great_expectations.yml work under a non-UTF-8 locale; an unreadable project YAML now raises an error naming the file. ([#12204](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12204))
- A spark_schema persisted in great_expectations.yml is loaded back through StructType.fromJson so the schema round-trips when the context is reopened, and an unsupported value raises a validation error naming the field and the accepted types. ([#12200](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12200))
- The Spark test-connection test, which covers behavior when PySpark is unavailable, is now skipped when PySpark is installed so it no longer fails for contributors with PySpark in their environment. ([#12199](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12199))
- config_variables.yml is now read and written as UTF-8, so saving and reloading a configuration variable containing non-ASCII characters works on hosts with a non-UTF-8 locale. ([#12182](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12182))

##### Docs

- The changelog now carries a deprecation timeline table listing every deprecated item, the version that deprecated it, and the version that removes it. ([#12224](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12224))
- Documentation fixes: the credential-configuration pages now point at gx/uncommitted/config_variables.yml, a mistagged code fence highlights again, a misspelled snippet name is corrected, and doubled words and spelling errors across the core docs, ADRs, gallery docs and contrib READMEs are fixed. ([#12177](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12177))
- Oracle is now documented on the connection-string reference (oracle+oracledb://...?service_name=...), the compatibility reference with its tested database version, and the data source method reference via add_sql. ([#12167](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12167))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- The pull request title check now requires exactly one current tag at the start of the title, and the contributor docs and template name only the four current tags. ([#12223](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12223))
- The published package metadata now includes project URLs linking to the source repository, documentation and homepage, so PyPI and dependency-tracking services can associate the package with its repository. ([#12207](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12207))
- The metric repository retriever tests are now type-checked, with concrete annotations replacing Any and the module removed from the mypy exclude list. ([#12184](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12184))
- The expectations test suite is now type-checked, including two guards that could never fail being corrected to actually test whether an optional dependency imported, and the directory-level mypy exclusion removed. ([#12185](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12185))
- Five more test modules are removed from the type-check exclusion list. ([#12178](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12178))

### 1.23.0 (2026-09-10)

Compatibility: new extra `oracle`

#### Highlights

- **`great_expectations[oracle]` is a supported install** — Oracle is now a published install path: installing the `oracle` extra brings in the Oracle driver and floors SQLAlchemy at 2.0, so the `oracle+oracledb` dialect the connection string needs is always available. The SQL dialect installation-commands table documents the new row. ([#12091](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12091))

  ```python
  pip install 'great_expectations[oracle]'
  ```

- **Daily and monthly Batch Definitions work on Oracle query assets** — Adding a daily or monthly Batch Definition to a query asset on Oracle previously failed with `ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis`, reported misleadingly as the partition column not being verifiable as a date or datetime. A query asset's SQL is now wrapped whole, so the Batch Definition can be created. As a side effect, a query whose SQL ends in a trailing line comment no longer breaks Batch Definition creation on any backend. ([#12162](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12162))

  ```python
  asset = datasource.add_query_asset(name="orders", query="SELECT id, created_at FROM my_table")
  asset.add_batch_definition_daily(name="daily", column="created_at")
  ```

- **Consistent verdict for z-score checks on zero or undefined variance** — `ExpectColumnValueZScoresToBeLessThan` used to disagree by backend on a constant column: pandas flagged every row as an outlier, PostgreSQL and SQL Server surfaced a division-by-zero error, and SQLite and MySQL quietly succeeded. All engines now agree that a column with zero or undefined standard deviation succeeds with no unexpected values. Anyone who relied on this Expectation to catch a stuck or constant column should use `ExpectColumnStdevToBeBetween` with a non-zero `min_value` instead. ([#12145](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12145))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValueZScoresToBeLessThan(column="constant", threshold=1.96, double_sided=True)
  # success=True, unexpected_count=0 on every backend
  ```

- **Mixed-case column names no longer break uniqueness checks on SQL backends** — `ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique` raised `KeyError: '<column>'` on case-insensitive SQL dialects (Databricks, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, SQL Server, Trino) whenever the column name was not already lower case and the result format asked for rows or unexpected indices. It now evaluates normally, so users who pinned to 1.19.1 for this reason can unpin. ([#12180](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12180))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique(column="CustomerID")  # result_format="COMPLETE"
  ```

- **SQL execution engines are reused instead of rebuilt on every validation** — Every validation against a SQL datasource used to build a new execution engine, with its own SQLAlchemy engine and connection pool, leaking an idle pooled connection per validation and re-running dialect setup each time. The engine is now cached as intended and rebuilt only when the datasource's connection configuration changes; a validation that follows a schema change still reflects the table afresh. ([#12148](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12148))

  ```python
  datasource.get_execution_engine() is datasource.get_execution_engine()  # now True
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- `ExpectColumnStdevToBeBetween` on SQLite now reports an undefined standard deviation as an `observed_value` of `None` — matching every other backend — instead of returning a result with no `observed_value` and an opaque "user-defined function raised exception" error, for columns with fewer than two non-null values and for empty tables. ([#12168](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12168))
- `ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique` no longer raises `KeyError` on SQL backends when a column name is not lower case and the result format requests rows or unexpected indices. ([#12180](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12180))
- `ExpectColumnValueZScoresToBeLessThan` now succeeds with no unexpected values on columns whose standard deviation is zero or undefined, on every backend, instead of failing on pandas or raising a division-by-zero error on PostgreSQL and SQL Server. ([#12145](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12145))
- Reading validation results and project YAML no longer fails with a `UnicodeDecodeError` under a non-UTF-8 system locale: filesystem store reads and project-configuration reads and writes are now pinned to UTF-8. ([#12125](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12125))
- Daily and monthly Batch Definitions can now be added to Oracle query assets, which previously failed with `ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis`; a query asset whose SQL ends in a line comment also works on every backend now. ([#12162](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12162))
- A query asset whose SQL ends in a `--` comment no longer fails validation: the raw SQL is normalized before it is wrapped, so appended text cannot land inside a trailing comment. ([#12124](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12124))
- SQL datasources now reuse their cached execution engine across calls instead of rebuilding it — and leaking a pooled connection — on every validation, while a validation following a schema change still reflects the table afresh. ([#12148](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12148))

##### Docs

- Updated repository links in the development, docs-contribution, support and compatibility-reference pages to point at the `fivetran/great_expectations` repository. ([#12126](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12126))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- `pip install 'great_expectations[oracle]'` is now a documented, supported install path, with SQLAlchemy floored at 2.0 so the Oracle dialect is available, and an install row added to the SQL dialect installation-commands table. ([#12091](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12091))
- Updated the docs site dependency joi from 17.13.4 to 17.13.7. ([#12176](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12176))
- Updated the docs site dependency svgo from 3.3.4 to 3.3.5, picking up security hardening. ([#12175](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12175))
- Removed five unreferenced checkpoint test fixtures and an entirely dead test `conftest.py`. ([#12174](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12174))
- Brought the previously excluded modules under `tests/integration/` into the type check, correcting their annotations and removing the covering exclude patterns. ([#12173](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12173))
- Brought the seven previously excluded modules under `tests/data_context/` into the type check and removed their exclude patterns. ([#12171](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12171))
- Updated the docs site dependency colord from 2.9.3 to 2.10.0. ([#12170](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12170))
- Brought the partition-and-sample execution engine test modules into the type check, fixing their annotations and removing the covering exclude pattern. ([#12169](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12169))
- Removed the unreachable `match_on` value key from the not-match-like-pattern-list metric, so the metric declares only the options it actually reads; `ExpectColumnValuesToNotMatchLikePatternList` never accepted `match_on` and still rejects it. ([#12157](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12157))
- Brought all modules under `tests/core/` into the type check and removed their exclude patterns. ([#12140](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12140))
- Brought the modules under `tests/render/` into the type check with annotation-only changes, leaving rendering behavior unchanged. ([#12152](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12152))
- Brought the validator metric-calculator and validation-graph test modules into the type check and removed their exclude patterns, with no production behavior change. ([#12149](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12149))
- Updated the docs site dependency fast-uri from 3.1.5 to 3.1.7, picking up security fixes. ([#12151](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12151))
- Updated the docs site dependency browserslist from 4.28.1 to 4.28.8. ([#12155](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12155))
- Contributors opening pull requests from forks once again receive the welcome comment: the broken Slack notification steps and unreachable workflow conditions were removed, and the pyspark 4 and marshmallow 4 lanes now gate required CI and publishing. ([#12159](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12159))
- Brought `tests/test_utils.py`, `tests/actions/` and `tests/checkpoint/test_checkpoint.py` into the type check, including fixes so a failed database connection surfaces its original error instead of an `AttributeError` from the cleanup path. ([#12146](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12146))
- The integration test harness now maps fixture float and datetime columns to portable SQL types, so fixture values are stored as declared instead of being silently rounded or failing table creation on some backends, with new tests pinning the per-backend renderings. ([#12147](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12147))
- Added a contract suite covering create, update and create-or-update for every registered fluent datasource type, and completed the type stubs so nineteen previously untyped factory methods now expose real signatures and return types to callers. ([#12141](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12141))
- Generalized the test harness's data source declaration record so non-SQL data sources can declare support tiers, and derived the lists that gate CI from those declarations rather than maintaining them by hand. ([#12110](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12110))
- Tightened the declared types for resolved metric values, render-content payloads and metric cache keys so callers type-checking against these APIs see fewer false diagnostics, with no runtime or signature changes. ([#12116](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12116))

### 1.22.0 (2026-08-31)

Compatibility: `marshmallow` minimum 3.7.1 → 3.18.0

#### Highlights

- **Marshmallow 4 is now supported** — Great Expectations now installs and runs against both Marshmallow 3 and Marshmallow 4, so it can be installed alongside deployments that pin Marshmallow 4 (such as Apache Airflow 3.3). The supported range is now `marshmallow>=3.18.0` with no upper bound; the declared 3.7.1 floor was unreachable in practice, so no currently-working environment is excluded. ([#12092](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12092), [#12118](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12118))

  ```python
  pip install great_expectations marshmallow==4.3.1
  ```

- **Oracle is now a live-tested backend, with three Oracle defects fixed** — Oracle joins the SQL test harness with live curated coverage, and the gaps that coverage exposed are fixed: regex Expectations now execute on Oracle instead of raising, query-based Expectations such as `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` now run because the derived-table alias is rendered in the form Oracle's grammar accepts, and daily and monthly batch definitions now work because the date-part string cast carries a length Oracle accepts. No other backend's rendered SQL changes. ([#12085](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12085), [#12103](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12103), [#12104](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12104), [#12102](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12102))

  ```python
  batch_definition = asset.add_batch_definition_daily(
      name="daily", column="event_date"
  )
  ```

- **`add_store` no longer crashes and empties great_expectations.yml** — Calling `context.add_store()` with an existing store's name and a config containing a `store_backend` key crashed and left `great_expectations.yml` at 0 bytes, making the project unloadable. The config is now serialized before the file is opened, so a serialization failure leaves the existing file byte-for-byte intact, and the context id is written as a string that YAML can represent. ([#12081](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12081))

  ```python
  current = context.config.stores[context.expectations_store_name]
  context.add_store(
      name=context.expectations_store_name,
      config={
          "class_name": current["class_name"],
          "store_backend": dict(current["store_backend"]),
      },
  )
  ```

- **Clearer errors for unsupported regex dialects and masked Azure account keys** — Regex Expectations run against a SQL dialect with no regex support now report `Regex is not supported for dialect <name>` in `exception_info` instead of an empty message, and Azure connection strings are masked regardless of field order so an account key can no longer appear unmasked in a `StoreConfigurationError`. ([#12109](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12109), [#12094](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12094))

- **Data Docs pages render for validation results with no run_id** — `context.build_data_docs()` silently dropped a validation result's page when the result's `meta` had no `"run_id"` key. Such results now render, with run name and run time shown as `__none__`. ([#12098](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12098))

  ```python
  context.build_data_docs()  # renders a page for every persisted result
  ```

- **Documentation for the bundled agent skills** — A new environment-setup page teaches how to install, verify, use, upgrade, and remove the agent skills that ship inside the `great_expectations` package, including the overwrite contract and the three skills as one path. ([#12074](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12074), [#12106](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12106))

  ```python
  python -m great_expectations skills install
  python -m great_expectations skills list
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Marshmallow 4.x is now supported alongside Marshmallow 3 on every supported Python version, with the supported range narrowed to `marshmallow>=3.18.0` and the `<4.0.0` cap removed; `config_version` bounds checking behaves identically on both majors. ([#12092](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12092))

##### Bug fixes

- `context.add_store()` no longer crashes and truncate `great_expectations.yml` to 0 bytes when re-supplying a store's own config containing a `store_backend` key; the project config is now serialized before the file is opened, the context id is persisted as a string, and an absent context id stays empty rather than becoming the string "None". ([#12081](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12081))
- The BigQuery taxi test fixtures now drop their table by name during teardown instead of enumerating every schema on the server, removing the multi-minute stalls that cancelled the docs-snippets CI job. Test infrastructure only; no shipped code path changes. ([#12119](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12119))
- Regex Expectations run against a SQL dialect without regex support (such as SQL Server) now report "Regex is not supported for dialect \<name>" in `exception_info` instead of an empty exception message, with the dialect name rendered cleanly. ([#12109](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12109))
- `ExpectColumnPairValuesToBeInSet` on pandas now returns a verdict instead of a `MetricResolutionError` when the evaluated rows do not use a zero-based consecutive index, such as after null filtering or with a custom DataFrame index. ([#12097](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12097))
- Non-security md5 calls now pass `usedforsecurity=False`, so batch identification, dataframe fingerprinting, and partitioning/sampling work on FIPS-enabled hosts. No computed digests change. ([#12099](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12099))
- Azure Blob Storage connection strings are now masked by parsing key=value pairs rather than matching one fixed field order, so a string with reordered fields or no `EndpointSuffix` no longer raises a `StoreConfigurationError` containing the raw URL and account key. ([#12094](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12094))
- `context.build_data_docs()` now renders a page for a validation result whose `meta` has no `"run_id"` key (or whose `run_id` is `None`), defaulting run name and run time to `__none__` instead of silently dropping the page. ([#12098](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12098))
- MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Redshift now declare a backend tier, so they run the metrics parameterizations they were silently absent from (+56, +44, and +56 tests respectively), and a new comparison keeps the two data-source list definitions from parting again; four regex metric modules exclude SQL Server, which has no regex operator. ([#12107](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12107))
- Query-based Expectations such as `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` now execute on Oracle: the derived-table alias is rendered through one shared helper that omits `AS` only for the grammar that rejects it, and the literal-boolean predicate rewrite now also applies to Oracle. No other backend's rendered SQL changes. ([#12104](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12104))
- Regex Expectations now execute on Oracle instead of raising `NotImplementedError`, via a new Oracle branch in the dialect-regex helper that renders `REGEXP_LIKE` in both positive and negated forms. No other dialect's rendered SQL changes. ([#12103](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12103))
- `add_batch_definition_daily` and `add_batch_definition_monthly` now work on Oracle: the multi-date-part partition query's string cast supplies an explicit length for the dialect that requires one, so batch retrieval no longer fails with `ORA-00906`. Curated coverage for daily and monthly batch definitions was added for every curated backend. ([#12102](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12102))

##### Docs

- Restructured the "Install agent skills" page for progressive disclosure — what the skills do now comes before prerequisites and install, a new "Use the skills" section follows install, maintenance detail is grouped under keeping the skills up to date, and the `--symlink` failure wording matches the installer's actual behavior. ([#12106](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12106))
- Documentation that teaches batch parameters now passes integers for numeric batch parameters uniformly across file, SQL, and directory sources, and the prose saying the accepted type depends on the asset family has been removed. ([#12066](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12066))
- Added a documentation page covering the agent skills bundled with GX: what they are, how to install and verify them with `python -m great_expectations skills install` and `skills list`, the overwrite contract, the three skills as one path, and how to upgrade and remove them. ([#12074](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12074))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Added a CI lane that installs the Marshmallow 4.x line, asserts the resolution actually landed on 4.x, and runs the unit suite against it. ([#12118](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12118))
- The SQL Server ODBC driver install script now bounds every apt call with a timeout, restricts its index refresh to the Microsoft repository, retries a failed install once, and the docs-snippets job gained a 30-minute timeout, so the step can no longer hang indefinitely. ([#12079](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12079))
- The Azure Blob Storage docs fixtures run against live storage again, with the account URL and container read from environment variables instead of a retired hardcoded host; the Spark ABS fixtures remain off. ([#12117](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12117))
- The docs-creds-needed CI leg now requests the BigQuery, SQL Server, and Redshift backends it already installs, so seven previously-skipped docs fixtures run; Snowflake and Azure stay unrequested and one Redshift fixture stays gated by name for lack of test data. ([#12114](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12114))
- The five pandas S3 docs fixtures run again, with the bucket read from a repository variable and authentication moved from static access keys to a role assumed through GitHub's OIDC provider; the S3 Spark fixtures remain skipped. ([#12111](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12111))
- Added a guard that compares the mypy configuration's relaxation surface against a committed inventory and fails the CI type-check in both directions, so adding an exclusion or relaxing override must be made visible in review. ([#12115](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12115))
- Removed two structural blockers to type-checking the test tree: deleted an `__init__.py` under a hyphenated, unimportable directory and gave `tests/integration/test_script_runner.py` its own shell helper instead of importing one from `assets/`. ([#12113](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12113))
- Cleaned up the mypy configuration so it reflects the codebase: 41 dead exclude patterns, 3 dead overrides, the SQLAlchemy import suppression and 1.x plugin, and 6 inert third-party suppressions removed; the generated version-file exclusion is anchored and the linter-ignore script's path filter corrected. ([#12112](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12112))
- Oracle joins the SQL data-source test harness as a live-tested backend, with a thin-mode `oracledb` driver requirement for the test lane, a pinned Oracle 21c container, an `oracle` pytest marker and CI lane, and curated-tier coverage; no `great_expectations[oracle]` extra is published yet. ([#12085](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12085))

### 1.21.0 (2026-08-19)

Compatibility: new extra `gcs`; `gx-sqlalchemy-redshift` removed (extra `gx-redshift`); `sqlalchemy-redshift` added (extra `gx-redshift`); `sqlalchemy` minimum  → 1.4.0 (extra `redshift`)

#### Highlights

- **Integer batch parameters work on every datasource family** — Numeric batch parameters such as `year` and `month` now accept integers on file, directory, and SQL assets alike, so a single `batch_parameters` dict drives one checkpoint spanning files and a warehouse. Digit strings still work but now emit a deprecation warning. A SQL request that matches nothing also explains why, distinguishing an empty table or column from candidates that exist but did not match, and naming the offending parameter and value. ([#12065](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12065))

  ```python
  checkpoint.run(batch_parameters={"year": 2020, "month": 4})
  ```

- **Agent-skill guidance ships with the package** — Great Expectations now bundles version-matched guidance for coding agents covering data source configuration, expectation authoring, and checkpoint orchestration, installable into a project's agent discovery directories. The guidance names the right optional dependency group for a missing driver, offers a batching cadence instead of assuming one, carries reuse-safe worked examples, and will not install packages, edit configuration files, create a project directory, or save files unless the user asked for it. ([#12061](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12061), [#12062](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12062), [#12063](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12063), [#12068](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12068), [#12073](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12073))

  ```python
  python -m great_expectations skills install --target all
  python -m great_expectations skills list
  ```

- **Two experimental expectations promoted into the core library** — `ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeOutliers` (IQR and standard-deviation methods) and the multicolumn values-equal expectation are now supported core expectations on Pandas, SQL, and Spark, with null-safe evaluation, Gallery metadata, prescriptive rendering, and public exports. ([#12011](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12011), [#12018](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12018))

  ```python
  gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeOutliers(
      column="fare_amount", method="iqr", multiplier=1.5
  )
  ```

- **Redshift installs the upstream SQLAlchemy dialect** — `pip install 'great_expectations[redshift]'` now resolves the upstream `sqlalchemy-redshift` 1.0.0 dialect with SQLAlchemy 2, replacing the Great Expectations fork and lifting a `sqlalchemy<2.0.0` pin that had been holding the dialect back at a three-year-old release. The `gx-redshift` extra keeps working as a deprecated alias that resolves identically. ([#12044](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12044))

  ```python
  pip install 'great_expectations[redshift]'
  ```

- **S3 requests are attributable to Great Expectations** — S3 clients built by Great Expectations now send a `great-expectations/<version>` user-agent suffix, appended to any user-supplied agent string rather than replacing it, so operators and S3-compatible providers can see which requests originate from Great Expectations. The S3 Data Source docs also clarify that `endpoint_url` is how you connect to a non-AWS S3-compatible store. ([#11937](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11937))

- **Data Docs no longer advertises a removed suite-editing workflow** — The "How to Edit This Suite" button and its popup, which pointed at a CLI command and notebook workflow that no longer exist, are gone from expectation suite and validation results pages, and expectation suite, profiling, and site index pages no longer render an empty "Actions" card. Validation results pages keep the Actions card and its Show All / Failed Only filter. ([#12078](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12078))

#### Deprecations

- Digit strings for numeric batch parameters (for example `\{"year": "2024", "month": "02"}`) are deprecated; pass integers instead (`\{"year": 2024, "month": 2}`). Removal in 2.0.0. ([#12065](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12065))
- The `gx-redshift` install extra is deprecated and is now an alias that resolves identically to `redshift`; use `great_expectations[redshift]`. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#12044](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12044))

#### Changes

##### Features

- S3 clients now carry a `great-expectations/<version>` user-agent suffix, appended to any user-supplied agent string, and the S3 Data Source docs clarify that `endpoint_url` connects to an S3-compatible object store. ([#11937](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11937))
- `ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeOutliers` is now a supported core expectation on Pandas, SQL, and Spark, with IQR and standard-deviation detection, consistent null handling, inclusive threshold boundaries, and a clear error for unsupported methods. ([#12011](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12011))
- The bundled agent skills now state up front, and again at each point they could act, that they will not install dependencies, edit configuration files, or save unrequested files without the user asking; the data source skill's batch-parameter examples were also corrected to use integers. ([#12073](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12073))
- The multicolumn values-equal expectation is promoted into the core library with null-safe equality on Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Spark, plus Gallery metadata, prescriptive rendering, and public exports. ([#12018](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12018))
- A third bundled agent skill covers checkpoint orchestration — binding assets and suites into validation definitions, grouping them into a named checkpoint with post-run actions, and verifying with one run — and the expectations skill now routes onward into it; writing a session out to a project also persists validation definitions and checkpoints and reports when an object already existed. ([#12068](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12068))
- Numeric batch parameters accept integers on file, directory, and SQL assets, so one `batch_parameters` dict drives a checkpoint spanning files and SQL; digit strings still work but warn, and a SQL request matching nothing now explains whether the data is absent or the parameter did not match. ([#12065](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12065))
- The bundled agent skills will not create a project directory unless the user has agreed to it and named the path, and the write-out offer is now the end of the flow rather than something done in the same breath as reporting results. ([#12063](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12063))
- The data source skill now names the correct optional dependency group for a missing driver (read from the installed distribution), keeps the batching question open until the verification probe reports the available columns, and carries the reuse guard inside its worked examples so copying one cannot silently replace an existing data source. ([#12062](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12062))
- Great Expectations ships agent-skill guidance for configuring data sources and expectations, installable with `python -m great_expectations skills install` and listable with `skills list`; the installer leaves already-correct destinations alone, refuses directories it did not write, and requires `--force` to replace user-edited copies. ([#12061](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12061))
- ClickHouse is onboarded as a first-class backend in the SQL integration test harness, which along the way fixed a quantile-metric helper that called a nonexistent execution-engine method and two shared test-harness defects. ([#12053](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12053))
- Trino is onboarded onto the SQL backend integration-test harness with a pinned container, a declared backend record, corrected double-quote identifier quoting for the dialect, and full curated-tier coverage. ([#12050](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12050))
- The SQL integration test harness gains a declarative backend framework: a new SQL backend is onboarded by declaring one frozen backend record (schema support, column type overrides, transaction mode, insert parameter limits, table schema items, tiers, and CI wiring) instead of adding dialect-specific branches, with onboarding documentation and a wiring drift check. ([#12049](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12049))

##### Bug fixes

- The Python 3.12 minimum-version test job installs dependencies and runs tests again, restoring minimum-version coverage and unblocking the required CI gate. ([#12076](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12076))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- The "How to Edit This Suite" button and its popup no longer appear in Data Docs, and expectation suite, profiling, and site index pages no longer render an empty "Actions" card; validation results pages keep the Actions card and its validation filter, and the `show_how_to_buttons` site config option still loads but gates nothing. ([#12078](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12078))
- The shipped `SparkDBFSDatasource` JSON schema description now includes the deprecation notice the Python API has carried since 1.16.0, so schema-driven consumers see it too. ([#12077](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12077))
- The distribution now ships version-matched expectation and datasource schema catalogs with index files mapping each datasource schema to its `add_or_update_*` factory method and each expectation to its schema, description, data quality issues, and supported data sources. ([#12055](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12055))
- BigQuery test tables are created in the configured dataset rather than in a per-config dataset, and the cleanup job sweeps stale tables within that dataset instead of querying project-level metadata it lacks permission to read. ([#12024](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12024))
- Added PostgreSQL integration coverage documenting that a quoted schema name on an asset is not honored as quoting today, with the passing bare-name control beside it so the behavior cannot be corrected without the test being updated. ([#12051](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12051))
- Removed the `gx-redshift` CI launch key now that the Redshift lane selects the canonical `redshift` marker; the deprecated `gx-redshift` install extra is unaffected. ([#12060](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12060))
- The `redshift` extra now installs upstream `sqlalchemy-redshift` 1.0.0 with `sqlalchemy>=1.4.0` instead of the Great Expectations fork, fixing a pin that had been silently installing a three-year-old dialect; `gx-redshift` remains as a deprecated alias resolving identically. ([#12044](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12044))
- The pull request template and AGENTS.md now state the RFC threshold for new backend support, a new advisory check asks contributors to answer that question when a change looks like new backend support, and the superseded Markdown issue templates that bypassed triage labeling are removed. ([#12043](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12043))
- The GCS documentation snippets run in CI again behind a dedicated `--gcs` flag, and the Spark-on-GCS guide is migrated to the current asset API so it no longer documents a call that raises. ([#12059](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12059))
- Restored GCP credentials for the docs snippets CI job and made the credentials path absolute so it resolves after the snippet runner changes directories. ([#12057](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12057))
- Corrected the stale patch paths in the pandas and Spark GCS datasource tests and added a `gcs_deps` marker and requirements file so they actually run in CI. ([#12058](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12058))
- GCS test and docs fixtures read the bucket name from a `GX_GCS_TEST_BUCKET` environment variable and raise clearly when it is unset; the published GCS guides now show a `my_bucket` placeholder instead of the real CI bucket. ([#12056](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12056))
- The SingleStore development container image used by CI is pinned to 0.2.82 instead of tracking `:latest`. ([#12054](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12054))
- Bumped mermaid from 11.15.0 to 11.16.1 in the documentation site dependencies. ([#12047](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12047))
- Bumped nanoid from 3.3.16 to 3.3.18 in the documentation site dependencies. ([#12052](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12052))
- Bumped dompurify from 3.4.12 to 3.4.13 in the documentation site dependencies. ([#12048](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12048))

### 1.20.0 (2026-08-07)

#### Highlights

- **Quantile expectations are correct on SQLite and no longer error on all-null columns** — `ExpectColumnQuantileValuesToBeBetween` now selects the right rank on SQLite and ignores null values when computing quantiles, so observed quantiles match the other backends. A column with no non-null values now reports an unmet expectation — `success: false` with null observed values and per-quantile success details — on every backend instead of raising a `TypeError` on SQL backends or an `IndexError` on Spark. ([#12008](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12008), [#12026](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12026))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  suite.add_expectation(
      gxe.ExpectColumnQuantileValuesToBeBetween(
          column="passenger_count",
          quantile_ranges={"quantiles": [0.25, 0.5], "value_ranges": [[1, 2], [1, 3]]},
      )
  )
  ```

- **Faster `expect_column_values_to_be_unique` on wide SQL tables** — The SQLAlchemy implementation of `column_values.unique` now scans the source table once through a narrow window over only the target column, and only retrieves full rows (via a narrow duplicate-key join) when `SUMMARY` or `COMPLETE` result formats are requested. Wide column-store tables — where the previous query was cancelled by Redshift's workload-management timeouts — now validate reliably. ([#11863](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11863))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique(column="id")
  ```

- **Validating multiple expectations on the same metric no longer fails on strict SQL backends** — When several expectations in a suite depend on the same underlying metric, the generated SQL now gives each metric a unique alias, so backends such as Postgres no longer reject the query with `Duplicated field name in view schema`. ([#11905](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11905))

- **File-backed Data Contexts work on read-only, version-controlled projects** — `gx.get_context(mode="file")` now recognizes a project as already set up based on a committed `great_expectations.yml` alone, instead of requiring the gitignored `uncommitted/` runtime directories. A clean checkout on a read-only filesystem is no longer mistaken for an unscaffolded project and no longer crashes during initialization. ([#12000](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12000))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context(mode="file", project_root_dir="/path/to/checkout")
  ```

- **`ExpectColumnValuesToMatchStrftimeFormat` is now a supported core Expectation** — The Expectation now carries full support metadata and a generated schema, appears in the Expectation Gallery with a properly rendered docstring and examples, and declares a backend matrix of Pandas and Spark (SQL is out of scope). ([#12009](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12009))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchStrftimeFormat(
      column="event_date",
      strftime_format="%Y-%m-%d",
      mostly=0.95,
  )
  ```

- **Adding a table asset is much faster on projects with many schemas** — `TableAsset.test_connection()` now probes the table first and only lists server schemas if that probe fails, purely to refine the error message. On backends where schema listing is a server-wide metadata operation — for example a BigQuery project with thousands of datasets — adding a table asset no longer pays that cost. Table configurations whose schema name did not match the normalized schema listing but were otherwise accessible now succeed. ([#12020](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12020))

  ```python
  asset = datasource.add_table_asset(name="my_asset", table_name="my_table", schema_name="my_schema")
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- `ExpectColumnValuesToMatchStrftimeFormat` is promoted to a supported core Expectation, with a corrected and Gallery-formatted docstring, support metadata, a generated JSON schema, a declared Pandas and Spark backend matrix, and expanded test coverage including `mostly` thresholds. ([#12009](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12009))

##### Bug fixes

- `ExpectColumnQuantileValuesToBeBetween` no longer reports a quantile one rank too low on SQLite and no longer raises on columns containing null values; quantile ranks are computed from non-null counts with exact fractional arithmetic, and the MySQL query applies the same null filter. ([#12008](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12008))
- `ExpectColumnQuantileValuesToBeBetween` now reports an unmet expectation, with null observed values and per-quantile success details, for a column that has no non-null values, instead of raising on SQL backends and Spark; the Spark metric returns one null per requested quantile so `column.quantile_values` has the same shape on every backend. ([#12026](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12026))
- Validating multiple expectations that share an underlying metric against a SQL backend no longer fails with a duplicated-field-name view schema error, because each bundled metric is now given a unique SQL alias. ([#11905](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11905))
- `expect_column_values_to_be_unique` on SQLAlchemy backends now runs a single narrow pass over the target column, and only joins back to the source for full-row details under `SUMMARY`/`COMPLETE` result formats, eliminating the Redshift workload-management timeouts seen on very wide tables. ([#11863](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11863))
- A file-backed Data Context can now be created against a fully-scaffolded, version-controlled project on a read-only filesystem: an already-set-up project is recognized from its committed `great_expectations.yml` rather than from gitignored `uncommitted/` directories, so a clean checkout is no longer destructively re-scaffolded. ([#12000](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12000))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- BigQuery tests run in CI again — the temporary unconditional skip for BigQuery-marked tests was removed — and the external-warehouse CI jobs now fail after 30 minutes instead of hanging for hours. ([#12016](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12016))
- Testing the connection for a table asset now probes the table first and only lists schemas on the failure path to refine the error message, so the operation no longer pays a server-wide metadata scan; error messages are unchanged. ([#12020](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12020))
- Updated the documentation site's `fast-uri` dependency from 3.1.4 to 3.1.5, which includes a security fix. ([#12019](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12019))
- Ephemeral schemas created by the SQL integration test suite are now namespaced under a `gx_ci_test_` prefix, and the stale-schema cleanup patterns were corrected to match hex suffixes so stale schemas are actually swept. No library behavior changes. ([#12015](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12015))
- Updated the documentation site's `brace-expansion` dependency from 1.1.16 to 1.1.18. ([#12014](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12014))
- Updated the documentation site's `postcss` dependency from 8.5.12 to 8.5.25. ([#12013](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/12013))
- Commenting `/assign-me` on an issue that is not yet labeled ready for work now gets a posted explanation of why the claim was declined and where to find issues open for claiming, instead of silently doing nothing. ([#11999](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11999))

### 1.19.1 (2026-07-24)

#### Highlights

- **Data Docs no longer errors when unexpected indices contain only id/pk columns** — Validation results that report unexpected indices made up solely of the configured id/pk columns — including Spark and SQL runs and any run with unexpected values excluded — now render a count and index table in Data Docs instead of failing the result page with "No group keys passed!". ([#11935](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11935))

- **Contributor License Agreement checks are now run by the project itself** — The verification/cla-signed check is posted by the repository's own workflows rather than a third-party hosted app: it is reported on pull request heads and on merge-queue commits, fails closed when contributor status cannot be confirmed, leaves a single guiding comment naming any unsigned or unidentified committer, and keeps the cla-signed / cla-not-signed labels in sync with the check result. CLA signing links now point at the current forms. ([#11985](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11985), [#11983](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11983), [#11980](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11980), [#11992](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11992), [#11982](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11982), [#11974](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11974))

- **Distinct-values set Expectations document their observed_value contract** — Documentation and JSON schemas for the distinct values set Expectations now state that observed_value is always None, and their code examples show unexpected_count and partial_unexpected_list (plus the missing-value variants) instead. ([#11934](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11934))

#### Changes

##### Features

- The verification/cla-signed check is now posted by this repository's own workflows instead of a third-party app: it enumerates a pull request's committers, fails closed when it cannot confirm them, supports re-running via an @cla-bot check comment, and posts a single guiding comment naming any unsigned or unidentified committer. ([#11985](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11985))

##### Bug fixes

- Data Docs now renders the unexpected count and index table when unexpected-index records contain only the id/pk columns, instead of failing the result page with "No group keys passed!". ([#11935](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11935))
- CLA labels on a pull request are now updated in the same run that posts the CLA status, so a pull request no longer keeps a stale cla-not-signed label after signing. ([#11992](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11992))
- Pinned the checkout action to v4.3.1 across workflows, restoring CI runs for contributor pull requests from forks. ([#11988](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11988))

##### Docs

- Documented that observed_value is always None for the distinct values set Expectations, refreshed their code examples to use unexpected_count and partial_unexpected_list, and synced the published JSON schemas to match. ([#11934](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11934))

- SqlAlchemy row-retrieval providers for map metrics (unexpected rows, unexpected index list, and unexpected index query) can now be overridden individually by a subclass without double-registering the metric; registration behavior for all existing map metrics is unchanged.

- Updated the documentation site's brace-expansion dependency from 1.1.13 to 1.1.16, picking up a security fix. ([#11991](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11991))
- Strengthened the tests that verify datasource lookups read their store just in time, so they now genuinely guard that behavior. ([#11949](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11949))
- Updated the pre-commit ruff hook from 0.15.12 to 0.15.15. ([#11895](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11895))
- Updated the documentation site's webpack-dev-server dependency from 5.2.5 to 5.2.6, picking up security fixes. ([#11990](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11990))
- Updated the documentation site's websocket-driver dependency from 0.7.4 to 0.7.5. ([#11977](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11977))
- Re-enabled Redshift tests in CI. ([#11984](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11984))
- The verification/cla-signed status is now reported on merge-queue commits, so the required CLA check can be satisfied in the merge queue instead of hanging pending. ([#11983](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11983))
- Updated the Contributor License Agreement links in CLA.md and the CLA bot message to the current signing forms. ([#11982](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11982))
- Pull requests are now blocked until every committer has a valid Contributor License Agreement signature, with cla-signed / cla-not-signed labels kept in sync with the CLA status. ([#11980](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11980))
- Snowflake connection tests no longer fail on a new pyOpenSSL deprecation warning raised during the TLS handshake. ([#11979](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11979))
- Corrected the Contributor License Agreement form links in CLA.md. ([#11974](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11974))

### 1.19.0 (2026-07-13)

Compatibility: `zstandard` added (extra `spark-connect`)

#### Highlights

- **Spark 4 and ANSI mode support** — Great Expectations now works with Spark 4, including ANSI mode, so you can validate Spark DataFrames on the latest Spark release without pinning to Spark 3. The `spark-connect` extra now also installs `zstandard`. ([#11969](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11969))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  data_source = context.data_sources.add_spark(name="my_spark")
  asset = data_source.add_dataframe_asset(name="my_df")
  batch = asset.add_batch_definition_whole_dataframe("batch").get_batch(
      batch_parameters={"dataframe": spark_df}
  )
  ```

- **Date-like strings stay strings in SQL value sets** — Distinct-value expectations against SQL data sources no longer turn non-ISO, date-like text such as "10-20" into a date, so text bins in a `value_set` compare correctly against text columns. Only strict `YYYY-MM-DD` strings are converted to dates. ([#11947](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11947))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  gxe.ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet(
      column="bin",
      value_set=["10-20", "20-30"],
  )
  ```

- **Clearer failure for an empty regex_list** — `ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegexList` now rejects an empty `regex_list` at construction time with the message "regex_list must not be empty", instead of failing later during validation with an opaque "No objects to concatenate" error. This matches the behavior of `ExpectColumnValuesToNotMatchRegexList`. ([#11958](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11958))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegexList(column="my_col", regex_list=[])
  # pydantic.ValidationError: ... regex_list must not be empty
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added support for Spark 4, including ANSI mode. ([#11969](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11969))

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed the broken contributing-guide link in the welcome message posted when an issue is assigned. ([#11961](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11961))
- `ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegexList` now fails at construction with "regex_list must not be empty" when given an empty list, instead of raising an opaque error at validation time. ([#11958](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11958))
- Non-ISO date-like strings such as "10-20" in a `value_set` are no longer parsed into dates for SQL distinct-value expectations; only strict `YYYY-MM-DD` strings are converted. ([#11947](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11947))

##### Docs

- Expanded the Ephemeral Data Context description on the Create a Data Context page to name CI pipelines and disposable or read-only compute environments as use cases. ([#11931](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11931))

<details>

- Removed the Codecov integration from continuous integration and from the project README; no library behavior changes. ([#11971](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11971))
- Databricks test runs now authenticate with a service principal using short-lived OAuth machine-to-machine tokens instead of a stored personal access token. ([#11970](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11970))
- Re-enabled the Databricks test suite and made the target catalog configurable rather than hard-coded. ([#11968](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11968))
- Removed unreachable expectation helper modules and unused internal types that were not part of the public API. ([#11765](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11765))
- Updated the documentation site dependency joi from 17.13.3 to 17.13.4. ([#11914](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11914))
- Made the pyarrow compatibility type-ignore valid whether or not pyarrow is installed, fixing static-analysis failures; no runtime behavior change. ([#11966](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11966))
- Updated the documentation site dependency dompurify from 3.4.3 to 3.4.11. ([#11917](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11917))
- Moved dialect-aware column type comparison used by the type and type-list expectations into a dedicated internal module with expanded unit-test coverage; behavior is unchanged. ([#11798](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11798))
- Removed unused code from the codebase. ([#11717](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11717))
- Updated the documentation site dependency launch-editor from 2.12.0 to 2.14.1. ([#11918](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11918))
- Added a comment-driven issue-claiming workflow (`/assign-me`, `/unassign-me`) with automatic release of idle claims, and narrowed issue staleness to issues labeled as needing more information. ([#11957](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11957))
- Rewrote the contributor documentation and added structured issue, bug-report, and request-for-comment templates. ([#11950](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11950))
- Snowflake connection tests now provision their own schema and table, so they no longer depend on pre-existing warehouse state or grants. ([#11945](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11945))
- Skipped the broken Google Cloud SDK setup and one credential-dependent docs snippet test so the documentation test job runs again during the continuous-integration transition. ([#11959](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11959))
- Replaced the broken video embed on the GX Core introduction page with a working YouTube embed of the same demo. ([#11932](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11932))

### 1.18.2 (2026-06-26)

#### Highlights

- **Spark Connect compatibility for distinct-values expectations** — Expectations that rely on a column's distinct values — including expect_column_distinct_values_to_equal_set, expect_column_distinct_values_to_contain_set, and expect_column_distinct_values_to_be_subset_of — now run successfully against a Spark Connect session (for example Databricks serverless via an `sc://` URL) instead of failing with a MetricResolutionError. Classic Spark sessions behave exactly as before. ([#11922](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11922))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  batch = ...  # a Spark Connect-backed batch
  batch.validate(
      gx.expectations.ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToEqualSet(
          column="color", value_set=["red", "green", "yellow"]
      )
  )
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Distinct-values Spark metrics no longer fail with MetricResolutionError on Spark Connect sessions such as Databricks serverless, so expectations like expect_column_distinct_values_to_equal_set work there again. ([#11922](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11922))

##### Docs

- Corrected three typos in the "Run a Validation Definition" guide in the GX Core documentation. ([#11920](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11920))

<details>

- Suppressed a third-party NumPy 'generic' unit deprecation warning so the BigQuery test suite can be collected on Python 3.13. ([#11924](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11924))
- Updated a parametrized test to pass a list instead of an iterator, fixing test collection failures with newer pytest releases. ([#11921](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11921))
- Updated the documentation site's @babel/core dependency from 7.28.6 to 7.29.6. ([#11925](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11925))

### 1.18.1 (2026-06-11)

#### Highlights

- **Data Docs now renders regex and other parameter values containing `<`, `>`, or `&` correctly** — Expectation parameter values are HTML-escaped before being substituted into Data Docs render templates. Previously, a regex containing angle brackets — for example the negative lookbehind `(?<!\s)` — was emitted raw into the HTML, where the browser treated `<!` as the start of a comment and silently truncated the rendered pattern. Such values now display literally in Data Docs. The public API and serialized Expectation format are unchanged; only the HTML rendering layer is affected. ([#11909](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11909))

  ```python
  gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegex(
      column="my_column",
      regex=r"(?<!\s)foo",
  )
  # The regex now appears in full in the generated Data Docs page.
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Expectation parameter values containing `<`, `>`, or `&` — such as regexes using a negative lookbehind — are now HTML-escaped and render correctly in Data Docs instead of being truncated or hidden. ([#11909](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11909))

##### Docs

- Remove the GX Cloud documentation site from the docs. ([#11906](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11906))
- The documentation site version label and the release version shown in docs content now read 1.18.0, matching the latest release instead of the stale 1.16.1. ([#11900](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11900))

</details>

### 1.18.0 (2026-06-02)

#### Highlights

- **GX Cloud paths now fail immediately with a clear explanation** — GX Cloud has been shut down. Constructing a `CloudDataContext` directly, or asking `get_context(...)` for a cloud context (via `mode="cloud"`, `cloud_mode=True`, a complete set of `cloud_*` arguments, or `GX_CLOUD_*` environment configuration), now raises a `GreatExpectationsError` right away instead of failing later with an opaque connection error. The message states that GX Cloud has been shut down and that these entry points will be removed in great_expectations 2.0. Non-cloud usage is unchanged, and the cloud classes and parameters remain importable with unchanged signatures through the 1.x line. ([#11894](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11894))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  # Raises GreatExpectationsError:
  # "GX Cloud has been shut down, so this no longer functions and will be
  #  removed in great_expectations 2.0."
  context = gx.get_context(mode="cloud")

  # Non-cloud contexts still work as before
  context = gx.get_context(mode="file")
  ```

#### Deprecations

- `CloudDataContext` and the GX Cloud branch of `get_context(...)` (the `cloud_*` parameters, `mode="cloud"`, `cloud_mode=True`, and `GX_CLOUD_*` environment configuration) are deprecated and now raise an error; the cloud-only exception, store, config, and identifier symbols remain importable only as shells. Use a non-cloud context such as `gx.get_context(mode="file")` or `gx.get_context(mode="ephemeral")`. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#11894](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11894))

#### Changes

##### Features

- GX Cloud has been shut down: constructing a `CloudDataContext` or requesting a cloud context from `get_context(...)` now raises a `GreatExpectationsError` explaining the shutdown instead of failing with an opaque connection error. Cloud classes and parameters stay importable with unchanged signatures until they are removed in great_expectations 2.0, and non-cloud usage is unaffected. ([#11894](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11894))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Temporarily skip the cloud object-store documentation examples (S3, GCS, and Azure Blob, plus Athena and AWS Glue) and the BigQuery, Redshift, and Snowflake documentation tests so the documentation-snippet CI job can run while that backend infrastructure is unavailable; Trino documentation tests still run. ([#11897](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11897))
- Tests marked for the Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, and Athena backends are now skipped with an explicit reason while that test infrastructure is unavailable. ([#11896](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11896))
- CI service container images (Spark, Postgres, MySQL, Trino, and others) are now pulled directly from Docker Hub, and the retired ECR pull-through cache and its login steps have been removed from the workflows. ([#11898](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11898))
- The Microsoft Teams notification integration tests are skipped because the webhook endpoint they posted to has been decommissioned; the mocked unit tests for that action are unchanged. ([#11893](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11893))
- The Snowflake type-list expectation test now accepts the length-parameterized `BINARY(8388608)` observed type that the Snowflake connector reports for `VARBINARY` columns. ([#11892](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11892))
- Removed the unused CodeSee architecture diagram workflow and its documentation entry. ([#11886](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11886))

</details>

### 1.17.2 (2026-05-14)

#### Highlights

- **SQLAlchemy 1.4 users can run uniqueness expectations again** — Expectations that resolve the `column_values.unique.condition` metric no longer fail on SQLAlchemy 1.4 with `AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute 'Select'`, restoring compatibility for dialects still pinned to SQLAlchemy 1.x (such as ClickHouse, Redshift, and Teradata). ([#11876](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11876))

- **Boolean options passed to pandas assets are preserved** — Boolean values such as `index_col=False` handed to `add_csv_asset` are kept as booleans instead of being silently converted to strings, so pandas interprets them as flags rather than column names. This applies to boolean options across the pandas asset types. ([#11867](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11867))

  ```python
  data_source.add_csv_asset(name="my_asset", path="data.csv", index_col=False)
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed an `AttributeError` on SQLAlchemy 1.4 when an expectation resolved the `column_values.unique.condition` metric, restoring SQLAlchemy 1.4 compatibility for unique-value expectations. ([#11876](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11876))
- Boolean arguments passed to `add_csv_asset` and other pandas assets, such as `index_col=False`, are no longer coerced to strings and are now applied as the boolean flags pandas expects. ([#11867](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11867))

### 1.17.1 (2026-05-05)

Compatibility: `pytest-split` added (extra `test`)

#### Highlights

- **Data Docs now load a patched jQuery** — Data Docs pages generated by Great Expectations now reference jQuery 3.7.1 instead of the vulnerable 3.4.1 (CVE-2020-11022, CVE-2020-11023). The Data Docs UI is unchanged and security scanners no longer flag GX-generated pages for this issue. ([#11856](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11856))

- **Spark column names containing dots now work** — Spark-backed data assets whose column names contain dots (for example `Data.Entrega`) can now be used in expectations without the spurious "The column X in BatchData does not exist" error. ([#11851](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11851))

  ```python
  batch.validate(gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="Data.Entrega"))
  ```

- **Nested Spark struct paths supported in unexpected_index_column_names** — Referencing a nested Spark struct path such as `Data.evt.id` in `unexpected_index_column_names` no longer raises `InvalidMetricAccessorDomainKwargsKeyError`; unexpected rows are surfaced keyed by the full dotted path. ([#11835](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11835))

  ```python
  batch.validate(
      gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet(column="value", value_set=[1, 2]),
      result_format={
          "result_format": "COMPLETE",
          "unexpected_index_column_names": ["Data.evt.id"],
      },
  )
  ```

- **Compound uniqueness expectations work on Spark timestamps with Pandas 2.x** — `expect_compound_columns_to_be_unique` and `expect_select_column_values_to_be_unique_within_record` no longer fail with `ValueError: Passing in 'datetime64' dtype with no precision is not allowed.` on Spark DataFrames that contain timestamp columns. Entries in `partial_unexpected_list` are now native Python values (for example `datetime.datetime` and `None`) rather than pandas/numpy equivalents. ([#11861](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11861))

- **Expectation subclasses can use aliased Pydantic fields** — Subclassing a built-in Expectation and declaring a field with `Field(alias=...)` no longer causes `ValidationError: extra fields not permitted` when validating a batch. ([#11854](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11854))

  ```python
  class MyExpectation(gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToStartWith):
      regex: str = pydantic.Field(alias="pattern")

  batch.validate(MyExpectation(column="name", pattern="^a"))
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Data Docs pages now load jQuery 3.7.1 instead of the vulnerable jQuery 3.4.1, addressing CVE-2020-11022 and CVE-2020-11023, with no visible change to the Data Docs UI. ([#11856](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11856))
- Test datasource names are now generated from UUIDs, removing a source of intermittent name-collision failures in the test suite; no library behavior changes. ([#11862](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11862))
- Compound and within-record uniqueness expectations no longer fail on Spark DataFrames containing timestamp columns under Pandas 2.x, and unexpected-value lists now contain native Python values. ([#11861](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11861))
- Expectation subclasses that declare a field with a Pydantic alias can now be validated without a spurious "extra fields not permitted" error. ([#11854](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11854))
- Restored the documentation-snippet integration tests that broke with sqlalchemy-redshift 1.0.0: the Redshift deployment snippet no longer references removed S3 store backends, and Snowflake key-pair authentication is used where configured. ([#11857](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11857))
- Expectations targeting Spark columns whose names contain dots now resolve correctly instead of reporting that the column does not exist in the batch. ([#11851](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11851))
- Nested Spark struct column paths such as `Data.evt.id` can now be used for expectation columns and unexpected index columns without raising an invalid-domain-kwargs error, and results are keyed by the full dotted path. ([#11835](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11835))

##### Docs

- The published changelog now includes the 1.17.0 release section alongside surrounding versions. ([#11865](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11865))
- Integration setup pages now link to the corresponding usage pages, making it easier to move from configuring an integration to using it. ([#11848](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11848))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Updated the documentation site's postcss dependency from 8.5.6 to 8.5.12. ([#11859](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11859))
- Continuous integration now shards and parallelizes the slowest database marker test jobs, cutting overall CI wall-clock time; `pytest-split` is now part of the development test requirements. ([#11850](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11850))
- Added a temporary continuous-integration trigger for pushes to a maintenance branch so workflow changes could be exercised before merge; no user-facing effect. ([#11858](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11858))
- Removed the long-deprecated `Expectation._atomic_prescriptive_template` method and its `add_values_with_json_schema_from_list_in_params` helper, both deprecated in v0.15.43; use `_prescriptive_template` instead. ([#11847](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11847))

</details>

### 1.17.0 (2026-04-22)

Compatibility: new extra `singlestore`

#### Highlights

- **SingleStore support** — Great Expectations now works against SingleStore databases: SingleStoreDB is recognized as its own SQL dialect, regex and uniqueness expectations produce correct results, quoted identifiers are handled, and setup is covered in the documentation. Install with the new `singlestore` extra. ([#11828](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11828), [#11839](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11839), [#11837](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11837), [#11842](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11842))

  ```python
  pip install 'great_expectations[singlestore]'

  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  data_source = context.data_sources.add_sql(
      name="my_singlestore",
      connection_string="singlestoredb://user:password@host:3306/my_db",
  )
  ```

- **strict_min and strict_max now respected in expect_column_value_lengths_to_be_between on Spark and SQL** — Passing `strict_min=True` or `strict_max=True` to `expect_column_value_lengths_to_be_between` previously produced inclusive-bound results on the Spark and SQL backends. Both backends now apply strictly exclusive bounds, matching the documented semantics and the Pandas backend. Non-strict usage is unchanged. ([#11834](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11834), [#11836](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11836))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  suite.add_expectation(
      gxe.ExpectColumnValueLengthsToBeBetween(
          column="name", min_value=2, max_value=4, strict_min=True, strict_max=True
      )
  )
  ```

- **Timezone-aware strftime formats accepted** — `ExpectColumnValuesToMatchStrftimeFormat` no longer raises a validation error when the format contains `%z`, and the Spark implementation of the underlying metric now validates timezone-aware formats correctly. ([#11812](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11812), [#11817](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11817))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchStrftimeFormat(
      column="ts", strftime_format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z"
  )
  ```

- **Forecast store bounds used for windowed expectations** — Windowed expectations now send each expectation's batch definition to the expectation-parameters endpoint, so users on the asynchronous forecast store path receive stored forecast bounds instead of falling back to inline training. Checkpoints spanning several batch definitions fetch and merge parameters for each one. ([#11831](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11831))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Windowed expectations now pass their batch definition when fetching expectation parameters, so forecast store bounds are used instead of inline forecast training; checkpoints with multiple batch definitions fetch and merge parameters per definition. ([#11831](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11831))

##### Bug fixes

- `expect_column_value_lengths_to_be_between` on Spark now honors `strict_min` and `strict_max`, excluding boundary lengths as documented. ([#11834](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11834))
- `expect_column_value_lengths_to_be_between` on SQL data sources now honors `strict_min` and `strict_max`, applying strictly exclusive bounds as documented. ([#11836](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11836))
- Fixed the Spark implementation of the strftime-format metric so timezone directives such as `%z` validate correctly. ([#11817](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11817))
- Fixed regex and uniqueness expectations against SingleStoreDB by recognizing it as its own SQL dialect, and enabled SingleStore tests in continuous integration. ([#11828](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11828))
- Fixed the release pipeline step that recorded contract releases, which failed because the pact command was unavailable; PyPI releases are unblocked with no end-user behavior change. ([#11819](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11819))
- `ExpectColumnValuesToMatchStrftimeFormat` no longer raises a validation error when the format string includes the `%z` timezone directive. ([#11812](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11812))

##### Docs

- Updated the Trino and BigQuery documentation, including coverage of query assets. ([#11747](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11747))
- Documented that `expect_column_proportion_of_non_null_values_to_be_between` supports a forecasted range. ([#11821](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11821))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Extended the retry window on the continuous-integration contract deployment check to 20 minutes so it can outwait slow provider verification. ([#11846](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11846))
- SingleStore test database is now initialized as a container service rather than through a test fixture. ([#11842](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11842))
- Added support for quoted identifiers when working with SingleStore data sources. ([#11839](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11839))
- Removed the long-deprecated `data_context`, `datasource_name`, `batch_parameters`, and `batch_kwargs` arguments (and their read-only properties) from the internal `Batch` class. ([#11843](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11843))
- Added test coverage for custom SQL expectations. ([#11844](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11844))
- Added documentation for connecting to SingleStore. ([#11837](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11837))
- Removed the `ColumnMetricProvider` alias and its deprecation-warning metaclass, which were deprecated in favor of `ColumnAggregateMetricProvider`. ([#11832](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11832))
- Restored clean static type checking after the pyarrow 24.0.0 release began shipping type information; no runtime behavior changed. ([#11838](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11838))
- Removed support for passing a plain string as `run_id` to `Validator.validate()`; a run identifier or dict is required. ([#11826](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11826))
- Contract verification now runs as its own independently retryable continuous-integration job that waits for provider verification to complete. ([#11822](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11822))
- The contract deployment check no longer fails its continuous-integration job, keeping the signal visible without blocking unrelated work. ([#11829](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11829))
- Resolved two denial-of-service advisories in documentation build dependencies by pinning path-to-regexp to 0.1.13 and picking up picomatch 2.3.2. ([#11824](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11824))
- Resolved documentation tooling advisories by upgrading minimatch to 3.1.5 and lodash-es to 4.18.1. ([#11827](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11827))
- Bumped jest-environment-jsdom to 30.3.0 in the documentation site to pick up a fixed picomatch dependency. ([#11823](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11823))
- Added a contract-compatibility deployment check to the cloud test job in continuous integration and removed a dead log-collection step. ([#11801](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11801))
- Bumped dompurify from 3.3.2 to 3.4.0 in the documentation site. ([#11820](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11820))

</details>

### 1.16.1 (2026-04-15)

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added 13 consumer-driven contract tests covering datasource API gaps, including data asset deletes, Postgres table/query assets with yearly and daily column partitioners, Snowflake DSN, connection-details and key-pair connection variants, and CSV assets with a daily file-name partitioner. ([#11813](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11813))

##### Docs

- The compatibility reference now states explicitly that Python 3.14 and later are not currently supported, alongside the supported 3.10–3.13 range. ([#11784](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11784))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Bumped the docs site's follow-redirects dependency from 1.15.11 to 1.16.0. ([#11815](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11815))
- The PyPI publish workflow now records each released version to PactFlow's production environment so compatibility checks gate against real releases. ([#11816](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11816))
- Removed the end-to-end docker-compose cloud tests, now superseded by contract tests, and dropped the associated Mercury startup steps from CI. ([#11811](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11811))
- Updated pre-commit hooks, moving ruff from v0.15.4 to v0.15.9. ([#11779](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11779))
- Added contract tests covering metric-run creation and the accounts/me lookup used when discovering workspaces during context initialization. ([#11804](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11804))
- Added contract tests for updating a validation definition and for fetching checkpoint expectation parameters. ([#11802](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11802))
- Added contract tests covering reading and saving data context variables. ([#11803](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11803))
- Contract publishing from merge-queue CI runs now uses the target branch name instead of the throwaway merge-queue ref. ([#11810](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11810))
- Contract tests now use fixed, isolated organization and workspace identifiers rather than environment variables, so provider verification no longer fails with authorization errors. ([#11808](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11808))
- Updated contract test fixtures to match the current cloud API, including the renamed analytics and validation-results-store configuration fields, 201 responses for datasource creation, recorded request bodies, and an isolated organization and workspace. ([#11797](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11797))

### 1.16.0 (2026-04-09)

Compatibility: `pact-python` added (extra `cloud`); `invoke` minimum 2.0.0 removed (extra `test`); `pact-python` minimum 2.0.1 → 3.1.0 (extra `test`)

#### Highlights

- **`column.unique_proportion` available in metric list runs** — Metric list runs can now compute `column.unique_proportion` alongside the existing column metrics, so you can retrieve the proportion of unique values per column without a separate run. ([#11786](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11786))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.experimental.metric_repository.metrics import MetricTypes

  metrics = [MetricTypes.COLUMN_UNIQUE_PROPORTION]
  ```

- **Suites added to an ephemeral context now pass freshness checks** — `context.suites.add(suite)` now returns a suite that matches what was stored, so passing that suite straight into `context.validation_definitions.add()` in an ephemeral context no longer raises a freshness error. ([#11758](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11758))

  ```python
  suite = context.suites.add(suite)
  context.validation_definitions.add(
      gx.ValidationDefinition(name="vd", data=batch_definition, suite=suite)
  )
  ```

- **Correct `exact_match` default in `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet` output** — Rendered descriptions for `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet` now reflect the expectation's real default for `exact_match`, so the rendered text no longer contradicts how the expectation actually validates. ([#11785](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11785))

- **Microsoft Teams and Jira integration documentation** — The documentation now covers setting up the Microsoft Teams and Jira integrations for GX notifications and issue tracking. ([#11761](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11761), [#11741](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11741))

- **No more unclosed-SQLite resource warnings on Python 3.13** — SQLAlchemy execution engines now dispose their connection pool when they are garbage collected, eliminating `ResourceWarning: unclosed database` noise and the spurious failures it caused on Python 3.13. ([#11766](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11766))

#### Deprecations

- `PandasDBFSDatasource` and `SparkDBFSDatasource` is deprecated; use datasources backed by Unity Catalog volumes, external locations, or workspace files. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#11759](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11759))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Metric list runs now support the `column.unique_proportion` metric, computed alongside other column-level metrics. ([#11786](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11786))
- Added an end-to-end contract test covering the full GX Cloud resource creation flow: datasource, expectation suite, validation definition, and checkpoint. ([#11783](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11783))
- Added client-driven contract tests covering datasource create, read, update, and delete through the Python client. ([#11754](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11754))
- Added client-driven contract tests covering expectation suite add, get, add-or-update, and delete through the Python client. ([#11756](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11756))
- Added client-driven contract tests covering validation definition and checkpoint add, get, and delete through the Python client. ([#11757](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11757))
- Contract testing now runs on pact-python v3, with matchers and interactions updated to the new API and the supported version range moved to 3.x. ([#11769](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11769))
- Removed the legacy hand-crafted HTTP contract tests and their supporting fixtures, which are superseded by the new client-driven contract tests. ([#11768](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11768))
- `PandasDBFSDatasource` and `SparkDBFSDatasource` are now marked as deprecated, following Databricks' deprecation of DBFS; the classes still work and will be removed in a future major release. ([#11759](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11759))

##### Bug fixes

- `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet` renderers now use the correct default value for `exact_match` in their rendered output. ([#11785](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11785))
- Pinned the development `invoke` dependency to 3.0.0 to avoid a breaking change introduced in 3.0.2. ([#11781](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11781))
- SQLAlchemy execution engines now dispose their engine and connection pool when garbage collected, preventing unclosed-SQLite resource warnings on Python 3.13. ([#11766](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11766))
- Adding a suite in an ephemeral context now returns a suite that passes later freshness checks, so using it in a validation definition no longer raises a resource freshness error. ([#11758](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11758))

##### Docs

- Documentation code blocks now keep lines marked as hidden out of view even when line numbers are shown. ([#11731](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11731))
- Added documentation for the Microsoft Teams integration. ([#11761](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11761))
- Added documentation for the Jira integration. ([#11741](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11741))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Release-tag CI runs no longer attempt to re-publish pact contracts, unblocking tagged releases. ([#11796](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11796))
- Contract tests match the `Gx-Version` request header with a pattern instead of a literal value, so generated contracts are stable across commits. ([#11791](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11791))
- Increased the SQL test connection pool size to reduce connection contention in Databricks and Snowflake test runs. ([#11793](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11793))
- CI skips code and test jobs for pull requests that only change documentation, and adds a single aggregate status check for branch protection. ([#11792](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11792))
- Bumped `brace-expansion` from 1.1.12 to 1.1.13 in the documentation site dependencies. ([#11777](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11777))
- CI publishes pact contracts against the pull request's head commit instead of the base branch commit, so provider verification runs against the actual changes. ([#11790](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11790))
- Fixed the CI pact-broker publish step so contract publishing actually succeeds and fails loudly when it cannot. ([#11787](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11787))
- CI now publishes generated pact contract files to PactFlow after cloud tests pass, skipping gracefully when no contracts exist. ([#11775](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11775))
- Bumped `lodash` from 4.17.23 to 4.18.1 in the documentation site dependencies, picking up prototype-pollution and template code-injection fixes. ([#11776](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11776))
- Removed the unreachable `great_expectations.profile` module and its tests as dead code. ([#11763](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11763))

</details>

### 1.15.2 (2026-04-01)

#### Highlights

- **BigQuery datasource methods now surface in IDE autocomplete and type checking** — The typed stub for `context.data_sources` now declares `add_bigquery`, `update_bigquery`, `add_or_update_bigquery`, and `delete_bigquery`, so BigQuery-specific datasource methods are discoverable in editor autocomplete and recognized by type checkers instead of pushing you toward the generic `add_sql` method. ([#11736](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11736))

  ```python
  datasource = context.data_sources.add_bigquery(
      name="my_bigquery_ds",
      connection_string="bigquery://my-project/my_dataset",
  )
  ```

- **New how-to guide: retrieve all unexpected rows** — The documentation now includes a "Retrieve all unexpected rows" guide under Run Validations, with a runnable example showing how to get the full set of unexpected rows from a validation definition, plus cross-references from the custom SQL Expectation guide and the result format reference table. ([#11712](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11712))

  ```python
  unexpected_rows = validation_definition.get_unexpected_rows(batch_parameters={})
  ```

#### Deprecations

- The `run_rest_api_pact_test` REST contract test helper is deprecated; use the client-driven Pact test approach built on the `pact_cloud_context` fixture. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#11753](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11753))

#### Changes

##### Features

- REST contract testing can now be driven from the client side: a `pact_cloud_context` fixture builds a `CloudDataContext` against the Pact mock server without real cloud credentials, a shared data-context configuration response and interaction helper are available for reuse, and the older `run_rest_api_pact_test` helper is marked deprecated. ([#11753](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11753))
- BigQuery datasource methods (`add_bigquery`, `update_bigquery`, `add_or_update_bigquery`, `delete_bigquery`) and the `BigQueryDatasource` type are now declared in the datasources type stub, so they appear in IDE autocomplete and type checking instead of requiring the generic `add_sql` method. ([#11736](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11736))

##### Docs

- Added a "Retrieve all unexpected rows" how-to guide with a runnable example script, a sidebar and landing-page entry, and cross-references from the custom SQL Expectation guide and the result format reference table. ([#11712](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11712))
- Applied a small documentation wording change based on engineering feedback. ([#11715](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11715))

### 1.15.1 (2026-03-13)

#### Highlights

- **Documentation for Expectation history** — The documentation now covers Expectation history, explaining how changes to an Expectation are tracked over time. ([#11704](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11704))

#### Changes

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Increased the timeout used when resolving Expectation parameters, so slower parameter lookups are less likely to time out. ([#11716](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11716))
- Removed support for the older nested format for configuring actions. ([#11713](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11713))

</details>

### 1.15.0 (2026-03-11)

#### Highlights

- **Fetch all unexpected rows from an UnexpectedRowsExpectation** — `ValidationDefinition.get_unexpected_rows()` returns every failing row for an `UnexpectedRowsExpectation`, without the 200-row cap applied to validation results. Validation results also gained an `ExpectationValidationResult.expectation` property and an `ExpectationSuiteValidationResult.batch_parameters` property, so you can feed a failed result straight back in to retrieve its rows. ([#11711](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11711))

  ```python
  result = validation_definition.run(batch_parameters={"year": 2026, "month": 3})

  for evr in result.results:
      if not evr.success:
          rows = validation_definition.get_unexpected_rows(
              evr.expectation,
              batch_parameters=result.batch_parameters,
          )
          if rows:
              write_to_quarantine(rows)
  ```

- **Documentation for SQL Server and Fabric data sources** — The docs now cover creating and using SQL Server and Microsoft Fabric data sources. ([#11686](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11686))

- **A single failing metric no longer fails the whole batch of metrics** — When bulk metric resolution hits an error, metrics are now retried individually, so one problematic metric no longer causes every metric in the run to error. ([#11708](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11708))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added `ValidationDefinition.get_unexpected_rows()` to fetch all failing rows for an `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` without the 200-row cap, plus an `ExpectationValidationResult.expectation` property and an `ExpectationSuiteValidationResult.batch_parameters` property for post-run workflows. ([#11711](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11711))

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed a regression where an error in a single metric caused every metric to fail; metrics are now retried individually when bulk resolution fails. ([#11708](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11708))

</details>

### 1.14.0 (2026-03-04)

Identical to 1.13.1, re-published the same day as a minor version: the release above carried a deprecation, which the minor number signals. No changes beyond 1.13.1.

### 1.13.1 (2026-03-04)

#### Highlights

- **Trust a SQL Server certificate without turning off encryption** — SQL Server and Fabric data sources accept a new `trust_server_certificate` option, so you can connect to a server presenting a self-signed or otherwise untrusted certificate while keeping encryption enabled instead of weakening `encrypt` to "Optional". The option works with both SQL Server authentication and Entra ID. ([#11694](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11694))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  datasource = context.data_sources.add_sql_server(
      name="my_sql_server",
      host="my-host",
      database="my_database",
      username="my_user",
      password="my_password",
      trust_server_certificate=True,
  )
  ```

- **Config variable substitution errors no longer echo secret text** — When a password or secret contains a literal `$`, Great Expectations no longer includes the text following the `$` in the resulting missing-config-variable error message, so part of the secret is not leaked in logs. The error guidance also no longer points at the retired `$MY_CONFIG_VAR` substitution syntax. ([#11693](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11693))

#### Deprecations

- The `schema_name` parameter on `TableAsset` and `add_table_asset` is deprecated; use the schema configured on the SQL data source's connection string. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#11689](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11689))

#### Changes

##### Features

- SQL Server and Fabric data sources accept a new `trust_server_certificate` option, letting you trust a self-signed or untrusted server certificate while keeping the connection encrypted, with both SQL Server authentication and Entra ID. ([#11694](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11694))

##### Docs

- The Cloud email alert documentation now lists ServiceNow as a supported third-party service and includes `*.service-now.com` in the default allowed email domains. ([#11669](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11669))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- The `schema_name` parameter on `TableAsset` and `add_table_asset` is deprecated; table assets now resolve their schema from the SQL data source they belong to, so specify the schema in the data source's connection configuration instead. ([#11689](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11689))
- Installed the SQL Server ODBC driver in the credentials-backed documentation test step so SQL Server examples in the docs are exercised in CI. ([#11698](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11698))
- Added Sentry error tracking to the documentation site, initialized early enough to capture errors that occur before the page finishes loading; the DSN comes from a `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable and no performance data is collected. ([#11695](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11695))
- Config variable substitution errors no longer include text that follows a literal `$` in a password or secret, avoiding partial secret leakage, and their guidance no longer references the removed `$MY_CONFIG_VAR` syntax. ([#11693](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11693))
- Updated the documentation site's `qs` dependency from 6.14.1 to 6.14.2. ([#11660](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11660))

</details>

### 1.13.0 (2026-02-26)

Compatibility: `altair` minimum 4.2.1 → 5.0.0; new extra `fabric`; removed extra `mssql`; new extra `sql-server`

#### Highlights

- **Microsoft Fabric datasource** — You can now connect to Microsoft Fabric with the new Fabric datasource, which authenticates with an Entra ID service principal. Install it with the new `fabric` extra. ([#11685](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11685), [#11662](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11662))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  datasource = context.data_sources.add_fabric(
      name="my_fabric",
      host="my-workspace.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com",
      database="my_warehouse",
      client_id="<client-id>",
      client_secret="<client-secret>",
  )
  ```

- **Distinct-value set expectations now compare in the database** — `ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet`, `ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToContainSet`, and `ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToEqualSet` now push set comparison into the database instead of pulling every distinct value into memory, so they stay fast and produce small results on high-cardinality columns. Results no longer include the full list of distinct values as `observed_value`; instead they report `unexpected_count`/`partial_unexpected_list` and/or `missing_count`/`partial_missing_list`, each capped at 20 values. ([#11614](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11614), [#11615](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11615), [#11616](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11616))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  suite.add_expectation(
      gxe.ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet(
          column="my_col",
          value_set=["a", "b", "c"],
      )
  )
  ```

- **"SQL Server" naming throughout, including the pip extra** — User-facing references to MSSQL are now written as SQL Server. Install SQL Server support with the renamed extra. ([#11674](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11674))

  ```python
  pip install 'great_expectations[sql-server]'
  ```

- **pandas 3 support** — The upper pin on pandas has been removed, so Great Expectations can be installed alongside pandas 3. BigQuery reads fall back to `pandas_gbq.read_gbq`, and chart rendering works with pandas 3's new string dtype default (requires altair 5). ([#11677](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11677))

- **ExpectAI documentation for the agent** — The documentation now covers ExpectAI for the agent, including its prerequisites. ([#11644](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11644), [#11678](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11678))

#### Changes

##### Features

- `ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToEqualSet` now compares the value set inside the database rather than loading all distinct values into memory. Results return `observed_value: None` along with `unexpected_count`, `partial_unexpected_list`, `missing_count`, and `partial_missing_list` (each capped at 20 values), and the rendered output marks unexpected and missing values accordingly. ([#11616](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11616))
- `ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet` now compares the value set inside the database rather than loading all distinct values into memory. Results return `observed_value: None` along with `unexpected_count` and `partial_unexpected_list` (capped at 20 values), and the descriptive value-counts bar chart is no longer produced. ([#11614](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11614))
- `ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToContainSet` now compares the value set inside the database rather than loading all distinct values into memory. Results return `observed_value: None` along with `missing_count` and `partial_missing_list` (capped at 20 values), and the rendered output marks missing values. ([#11615](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11615))
- Added a Microsoft Fabric datasource with `add_fabric()`, `update_fabric()`, and `delete_fabric()` APIs, authenticated with an Entra ID service principal. ([#11685](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11685))
- A top-level ORDER BY in a user-supplied query is now stripped automatically when that query is wrapped in a row count, so SQL Server no longer rejects it. ORDER BY inside window functions or nested subqueries, and queries using OFFSET, are left untouched. ([#11670](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11670))

##### Bug fixes

- When a metric computation fails twice on a SQL Server connection, the connection is now explicitly rolled back before the error is raised, so closing the connection no longer hangs. ([#11680](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11680))
- SQL expectations using the `{batch}` placeholder on Databricks no longer fail with a cast error, because batch queries are now compiled with the datasource's own dialect so identifiers are quoted correctly. ([#11671](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11671))

##### Docs

- Refined the prerequisites documentation for using ExpectAI with the agent. ([#11678](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11678))
- Added documentation for using ExpectAI with the agent. ([#11644](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11644))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Store backend implementations that were deprecated in the v1 release, along with the documentation examples that referenced them, have been removed. ([#11675](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11675))
- SQL Server column types are now reported consistently between the metric repository and `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType`/`ExpectColumnValuesToBeInTypeList`, compared case-insensitively and without `COLLATE` clauses in the type string. ([#11684](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11684))
- The upper pin on pandas has been removed so Great Expectations works with pandas 3, with BigQuery reads falling back to `pandas_gbq.read_gbq` and chart rendering updated for the new string dtype default. ([#11677](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11677))
- Test helpers now build an ephemeral context via `gx.get_context(mode="ephemeral")` instead of the removed `build_in_memory_runtime_context` helper, eliminating a source of flaky tests. ([#11683](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11683))
- Removed the repeated noisy `_get_default_value called with key ... but it is not a known field` INFO log messages emitted during checkpoint validation. ([#11626](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11626))
- MSSQL references are now named SQL Server throughout: the pip extra is `sql-server` instead of `mssql`, and related enum members, helper names, pytest markers, and the test CLI flag were renamed to match. The SQLAlchemy dialect value `mssql` is unchanged. ([#11674](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11674))
- Datasource marker tests now run against a single Python version on pull requests, with the full version matrix reserved for releases. ([#11666](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11666))
- Failed SQL Server connection tests now report human-readable error messages. ([#11661](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11661))
- Removed Entra ID Password authentication, which Microsoft's mandatory MFA enforcement makes unusable. ([#11665](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11665))
- Added a published JSON schema for the SQL Server datasource, documenting its connection-detail options. ([#11662](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11662))
- Added Azure AD service principal authentication details for SQL Server connections and corrected the casing of the authentication query parameter used for Azure AD password authentication. ([#11653](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11653))

</details>

### 1.12.3 (2026-02-13)

#### Highlights

- **SQL Server datasources with Azure AD password authentication** — You can now connect to SQL Server with a flat set of connection keyword arguments, including Azure Active Directory password authentication, without hand-building a connection string. ([#11645](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11645), [#11640](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11640), [#11643](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11643))

  ```python
  context.data_sources.add_sql_server(
      name="my_sql_server",
      host="my-server.database.windows.net",
      database="my_db",
      username="user@example.com",
      password="${MY_PASSWORD}",
  )
  ```

- **Broader Microsoft SQL Server support** — SQL Server now works with schemas, with bracket-quoted identifiers such as [my column], and with UnexpectedRowsExpectation queries. ([#11649](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11649), [#11652](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11652), [#11646](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11646))

- **unexpected_index_query is returned for ExpectCompoundColumnsToBeUnique on SQL** — ExpectCompoundColumnsToBeUnique run against SQL data sources now returns unexpected_index_query when you request it with return_unexpected_index_query=True or use the COMPLETE result format, so you can retrieve every failing row beyond the 200-row unexpected_list limit. COMPLETE also now honors return_unexpected_index_query=False when you set it explicitly. ([#11639](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11639))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(
      ExpectCompoundColumnsToBeUnique(column_list=["a", "b"]),
      result_format={"result_format": "COMPLETE"},
  )
  print(result.result["unexpected_index_query"])
  ```

- **pandas Timestamp values accepted in datetime comparisons** — Datetime comparison expectations now handle pandas.Timestamp values correctly, checking the most specific type first so Timestamps are no longer mis-handled as plain dates. ([#11637](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11637))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Dialect quoting now supports asymmetric identifier quote characters, so SQL Server bracket-quoted identifiers such as [my column] are handled correctly (double-quoted identifiers are also accepted for SQL Server). ([#11652](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11652))
- SQL Server data sources now support schemas, including schema names that contain upper-case characters. ([#11649](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11649))
- Added SQL Server Azure AD password authentication and a flat keyword-argument style for add_sql_server, update_sql_server, and add_or_update_sql_server, with type stubs for both calling styles. ([#11645](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11645))
- UnexpectedRowsExpectation now works against SQL Server, including queries that previously relied on unsupported SQL constructs. ([#11646](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11646))
- Added SQL Server type stubs and switched the integration tests to the public SQL Server datasource API. ([#11643](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11643))

##### Bug fixes

- Datetime comparison operations now accept pandas.Timestamp values, checking Timestamp before datetime and date so timestamps are compared correctly. ([#11637](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11637))
- ExpectCompoundColumnsToBeUnique on SQL data sources now returns unexpected_index_query when requested or when using the COMPLETE result format, and COMPLETE respects return_unexpected_index_query=False when explicitly set. ([#11639](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11639))
- Removed the vestigial, unsupported table domain key from ExpectColumnToExist. ([#11630](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11630))

##### Docs

- Removed documentation about the deprecated DBFS support. ([#11648](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11648))
- Added documentation for adding an Expectation using the GX Cloud API. ([#11567](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11567))
- Revised the contribution guidelines to encourage pull requests for new features and to clarify the acceptance criteria for contributions. ([#11638](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11638))
- Added documentation for email alerts. ([#11628](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11628))
- Fixed a broken documentation link to expect_table_row_count_to_equal_other_table. ([#11634](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11634))
- The core result format documentation now defines the meaning of the asterisks used in its tables. ([#11631](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11631))
- Added documentation describing the next steps after an agent request. ([#11619](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11619))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Integration tests now dispose of SQL Server connections when they finish. ([#11663](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11663))
- Raised the container startup timeout used by the test suites to three minutes to reduce flaky CI failures. ([#11659](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11659))
- Added a healthcheck start period and RabbitMQ readiness check to the local Mercury docker-compose stack to prevent flaky CI failures. ([#11655](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11655))
- Introduced a SQLServerDatasource with structured SQL Server authentication connection details, validating that connection URLs use the mssql+pyodbc scheme and supporting config-substituted passwords. ([#11640](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11640))
- Bumped webpack from 5.94.0 to 5.104.1 in the documentation site. ([#11636](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11636))
- Added database-pushdown metrics for distinct-value set comparisons (column.distinct_values.not_in_set, column.distinct_values.not_in_set.count, column.distinct_values.missing_from_column, and column.distinct_values.missing_from_column.count) that evaluate set comparisons in the database instead of fetching all distinct values into memory, with type coercion for date strings. ([#11629](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11629))
- Bumped diff from 3.5.0 to 3.5.1 in the documentation site. ([#11627](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11627))
- Removed a duplicated flaky pandas result-format test from the test suite. ([#11623](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11623))

### 1.11.3 (2026-01-29)

#### Highlights

- **Row conditions work again on SQLAlchemy 1.x data sources** — Validating an expectation with a `row_condition` against a SQLAlchemy 1.x data source no longer fails with `AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute 'ColumnElement'`. Row conditions now work on both SQLAlchemy 1.x and 2.x. ([#11612](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11612))

- **Redshift column detection works for tables in non-default schemas** — Redshift assets backed by a table in a non-default schema (for example `bi_db.my_table`) no longer fail column detection with `relation "my_table" does not exist`; the fallback lookup is now schema-qualified. ([#11606](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11606))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Using a `row_condition` with a SQLAlchemy 1.x data source no longer raises `AttributeError: module 'sqlalchemy' has no attribute 'ColumnElement'`. ([#11612](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11612))
- Redshift fallback column detection now schema-qualifies its query, so tables in a non-default schema no longer fail with a "relation does not exist" error. ([#11606](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11606))

##### Docs

- Added documentation for the Atlan integration. ([#11580](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11580))
- Updated links to the `airflow-provider-great-expectations` documentation and removed an unused CI script. ([#11621](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11621))

### 1.11.2 (2026-01-22)

Compatibility: `pandas` minimum set to 1.3.0 (`python_version >= "3.12"`)

#### Highlights

- **pandas 3.0 is excluded from supported versions** — Installations now resolve a `pandas` version below 3.0.0, so environments no longer pick up an incompatible pandas 3.x release. On Python 3.12 and newer, the minimum supported `pandas` version is 1.3.0. ([#11607](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11607))

- **Refreshed Result format documentation** — The documentation covering result format has been reworked so it is easier to find the right result format setting and understand what each one returns. ([#11596](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11596))

- Constrained the supported `pandas` version to below 3.0.0. ([#11607](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11607))

</details>

### 1.11.1 (2026-01-20)

#### Highlights

- **Result-format levels are now respected for Custom SQL and Multi-Source Expectations** — Validation results for Custom SQL and Multi-Source Expectations no longer include row-level data at result-format levels below COMPLETE. BOOLEAN_ONLY returns only success; BASIC and SUMMARY add the observed value (Custom SQL) or unexpected count and percent (Multi-Source); unexpected and missing rows appear only with COMPLETE. Multi-Source Expectations also render correctly when the result is empty. ([#11601](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11601))

- **get_context is recognized as a public export by type checkers** — The top-level great_expectations module now declares its public symbols explicitly, so static type checkers such as Pyright no longer report get_context and other promoted symbols as not exported. ([#11578](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11578))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Custom SQL and Multi-Source Expectation validation results now include row-level data only at the COMPLETE result format, matching the BOOLEAN_ONLY, BASIC, SUMMARY, and COMPLETE hierarchy, and Multi-Source Expectations no longer fail to render when the result is empty. ([#11601](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11601))
- Added an explicit public-symbol list to the top-level great_expectations module so static type checkers recognize get_context and other promoted symbols as exported. ([#11578](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11578))
- Expectation configuration equality now accounts for the Expectation ID, so suites containing multiple Expectations with identical kwargs and meta but different IDs no longer produce missing or duplicated validation results. ([#11593](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11593))

### 1.11.0 (2026-01-12)

#### Highlights

- **Unexpected rows are returned as dictionaries for Map expectations** — Map expectation validation results now report `unexpected_rows` as dictionaries keyed by column name instead of database-specific row objects rendered as tuples, so results are easier to parse and no longer depend on an opt-in flag. ([#11591](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11591), [#11583](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11583))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(expectation)
  # result["result"]["unexpected_rows"]
  # [{"col_a": 1.0, "col_b": 1.0, "col_c": 2.0}]
  ```

- **Column-based validations work on Redshift batches** — `batch.columns()` no longer returns an empty list for Redshift batches on clusters with restricted `information_schema` access, and table names given as `"schema.table"` are resolved correctly, so column-based expectations run instead of failing with a metric domain error. ([#11534](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11534))

  ```python
  batch = batch_definition.get_batch()
  print(batch.columns())
  ```

- **Unexpected index query available with SUMMARY result format** — `return_unexpected_index_query` is now supported with the SUMMARY result format, matching what BASIC already offered. ([#11594](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11594))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(
      expectation,
      result_format={
          "result_format": "SUMMARY",
          "unexpected_index_column_names": ["pk"],
          "return_unexpected_index_query": True,
      },
  )
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Map expectation validation results now serialize `unexpected_rows` as dictionaries by default, and the `map_expectation_unexpected_rows_as_dict` opt-in flag is no longer needed. ([#11591](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11591))

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed `batch.columns()` returning an empty list for Redshift batches, which caused column-based expectations to fail; column names are now retrieved via a fallback query when `information_schema` is inaccessible, and `table_name` values of the form `"schema.table"` are parsed correctly. ([#11534](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11534))

##### Docs

- Documentation no longer labels ExpectAI as beta. ([#11590](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11590))
- Removed temporary notes about row conditions from the documentation. ([#11581](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11581))
- The copy button on documentation code blocks no longer copies hidden lines. ([#11571](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11571))
- Reframed and clarified the documented Data Source limitations. ([#11570](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11570))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- `return_unexpected_index_query` is now supported with the SUMMARY result format, so SUMMARY is no longer more limited than BASIC. ([#11594](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11594))
- Suppressed `DeprecationWarning`s emitted by dependencies so local test runs are not failed by them. ([#11587](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11587))
- Added an opt-in `map_expectation_unexpected_rows_as_dict` Checkpoint setting that serializes `unexpected_rows` as dictionaries for all Map expectations on SQLAlchemy and Spark, with the default output unchanged. ([#11583](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11583))
- `invoke deps` accepts `--pty` and `--no-pty` flags so automated environments can control pseudo-terminal usage. ([#11586](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11586))
- Improved the local type-checking developer experience: fixed type errors, silenced `pyparsing` deprecation warnings via the compatibility layer, and documented the type-checking workflow so local runs match CI. ([#11574](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11574))

### 1.10.0 (2025-12-18)

#### Highlights

- **Unexpected-index columns and unexpected queries on BOOLEAN_ONLY and BASIC result formats** — Result formats BOOLEAN_ONLY and BASIC now support returning primary-key/unexpected-index columns and the unexpected-rows query, so you can identify failing rows without switching to a more verbose result format. ([#11563](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11563))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(
      expectation,
      result_format={
          "result_format": "BASIC",
          "unexpected_index_column_names": ["pk_1"],
      },
  )
  ```

#### Changes

</details>

### 1.9.3 (2025-12-10)

#### Highlights

- **Primary key information in column type metrics** — The `table.column_types` metric now reports whether each column is part of the table's primary key when using a SQL (SQLAlchemy) execution engine. Single-column, composite, and quoted primary keys are all detected, and columns in tables without a primary key are reported as not primary keys. ([#11554](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11554))

  ```python
  # Each entry in the metric value now includes a `primary_key` flag:
  # [
  #     {"name": "id", "type": "UUID", "primary_key": True},
  #     {"name": "created_at", "type": "TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE", "primary_key": False},
  # ]
  ```

- **Oracle query assets no longer get an unwanted FROM DUAL clause** — Querying Oracle data sources through SQLAlchemy no longer appends a spurious `FROM DUAL` clause to an already well-formed SQL query, so query assets against Oracle run as written. Verified against Oracle 19c and PostgreSQL 10.16. ([#11538](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11538))

#### Changes

##### Features

- The `table.column_types` metric now includes a `primary_key` flag for each column when read through a SQL execution engine, covering single-column, composite, and quoted primary keys. ([#11554](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11554))

##### Bug fixes

- Queries against Oracle data sources are no longer rewritten with an extra `FROM DUAL` clause when the query is already properly formatted. ([#11538](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11538))

##### Docs

- Updated the documentation covering unexpected rows. ([#11553](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11553))

### 1.9.2 (2025-12-03)

#### Highlights

- **Fluent Snowflake datasource update methods** — Snowflake datasources can now be updated or upserted through the fluent API with `update_snowflake` and `add_or_update_snowflake`, matching the methods already available for other datasource types. ([#11520](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11520))

  ```python
  context.data_sources.add_or_update_snowflake(
      name="my_snowflake_ds",
      connection_string="snowflake://<user>@<account>/<database>/<schema>?warehouse=<wh>&role=<role>",
  )
  ```

- **Documentation for running validations with the GX Cloud API** — The documentation now explains how to run validations using the GX Cloud API, including what is supported and how results are handled. ([#11400](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11400))

- **Documentation for Custom Actions in GX Cloud** — New documentation describes how to configure and use Custom Actions in GX Cloud. ([#11521](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11521))

- **Dependency compatibility reference expanded** — The compatibility reference in the docs now lists supported dependencies, so you can check which versions work with your installation before upgrading. ([#11530](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11530))

#### Deprecations

- Passing `private_key` inside a Snowflake datasource's `kwargs` is deprecated; use the datasource's dedicated `private_key` connection argument. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#11520](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11520))

#### Changes

- Passing a string to `row_condition`, or supplying `condition_parser`, now raises a DeprecationWarning pointing to Condition objects (for example `Column("age") > 18`) instead. ([#11515](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11515))
- Updated the CI test exclude list so tests are required on Python 3.10, now the minimum supported version. ([#11517](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11517))

</details>

### 1.9.0 (2025-11-07)

Compatibility: Python `<3.14,>=3.9` → `<3.14,>=3.10`; `numpy` removed (`python_version == "3.9"`); `pandas` removed (`python_version == "3.9"`)

#### Highlights

- **Row conditions: documented, importable, and rendered in Data Docs** — Row conditions are now a supported way to scope an Expectation to a subset of rows. The condition classes (including `Column` and the comparison, nullity, and boolean conditions) are part of the public API and are imported from `great_expectations.expectations.row_conditions`; the previous `great_expectations.expectations.conditions` import path still works. Conditions are validated more strictly (an in/not-in parameter must be an iterable whose members share a single type, and boolean members are rejected), a bare string condition is always turned into a condition object even when no condition parser is given, and Data Docs now renders every condition when an Expectation carries more than one. New documentation pages, screenshots, and notes on the minimum GX Cloud API and agent versions required for certain row-condition features round this out. ([#11478](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11478), [#11494](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11494), [#11497](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11497), [#11500](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11500), [#11504](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11504), [#11506](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11506), [#11507](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11507), [#11509](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11509), [#11511](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11511), [#11512](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11512))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.expectations.row_conditions import Column

  condition = Column("age") > 21
  ```

- **Python 3.10 is now the minimum supported version** — Great Expectations no longer supports Python 3.9. Install on Python 3.10 or newer; the documentation now states 3.10 as the minimum. ([#11501](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11501), [#11485](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11485))

- **`unexpected_index_column_names` returned by ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull** — When you request unexpected index columns in `result_format`, ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull now includes `unexpected_index_column_names` in its validation result, matching the other column-value Expectations. ([#11513](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11513))

  ```python
  result_format={"result_format": "COMPLETE", "unexpected_index_column_names": ["customer_id"]}
  ```

#### Changes

- Added the Snowflake private key to the continuous integration environment variables. ([#11499](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11499))

### 1.8.1 (2025-10-30)

#### Highlights

- **Null checks in row conditions** — Row conditions now express null comparisons explicitly with `is_null()` and `is_not_null()` on a column, and passing `None` as the value of a comparison operator is rejected instead of silently producing an invalid condition. ([#11491](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11491))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe
  from great_expectations.core.expectation_condition import Column

  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(
      column="amount",
      min_value=0,
      row_condition=Column("cancelled_at").is_null(),
  )
  ```

- **Legacy row condition strings keep working alongside condition objects** — Existing string-based `row_condition` values are accepted and converted into the new condition objects, the `condition_parser` field is preserved, pandas and Spark conditions have a passthrough path, and rendered expectation content displays the new condition types correctly. ([#11474](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11474), [#11484](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11484), [#11480](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11480), [#11481](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11481))

- **Clearer limits on combining row conditions** — Nested `AndCondition`s are flattened automatically, while `OrCondition`s nested inside `AndCondition`s or other `OrCondition`s now raise an explicit error, as does supplying more than 100 conditions. ([#11488](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11488))

- **Updated Snowflake connection documentation** — The Snowflake documentation now covers the deprecation of password authentication and gives corrected guidance for configuring private key authentication. ([#11416](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11416), [#11490](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11490))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Test runs no longer fail on the `google.api_core` Python 3.10 end-of-life warning. ([#11493](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11493))
- Cloud-marked tests can no longer reach the live API: unmocked HTTP requests are blocked, preventing accidental production calls during test runs. ([#11492](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11492))
- Rendered expectation content is generated correctly for the new row condition types. ([#11481](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11481))

##### Docs

- Corrected the Snowflake private key authentication guidance. ([#11490](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11490))
- Documented the deprecation of Snowflake password authentication and the recommended alternatives. ([#11416](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11416))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Passing `None` as the value of a column comparison in a row condition is now rejected; use `is_null()` or `is_not_null()` for null checks, and the comparison parameter is required. ([#11491](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11491))
- Expectation suites stored in GX Cloud are now read and written through the v2 REST endpoints. ([#11487](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11487))
- Microsoft SQL Server drivers are installed in CI only for the jobs that need them, and the installation script reports failures more clearly. ([#11489](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11489))
- Row condition groups are constrained: nested `AndCondition`s are flattened, `OrCondition`s nested inside `AndCondition`s or `OrCondition`s raise an error, and more than 100 conditions raises an error. ([#11488](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11488))
- Added a passthrough path for the pandas and Spark row condition parsers so existing condition expressions are handled directly. ([#11480](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11480))
- Test runs no longer surface the Python 3.9 end-of-life future warning. ([#11486](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11486))
- Spark test environments now use the Apache-published Spark image after the previously used Bitnami image was removed. ([#11444](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11444))
- The `condition_parser` field is retained for backwards compatibility so single-condition row conditions still convert to string syntax on older API versions. ([#11484](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11484))
- Legacy string `row_condition` values are transformed into the new condition objects. ([#11474](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11474))
- Disabled the documentation link checker, which was reporting too many false positives. ([#11477](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11477))
- Python 3.12 marker tests no longer run on every pull request; only the minimum and maximum supported Python versions are exercised for those events. ([#11457](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11457))

</details>

### 1.8.0 (2025-10-23)

#### Highlights

- **Snowflake key pair authentication** — Snowflake data sources now accept key pair authentication as a first-class part of the connection API, so you can configure a Snowflake data source with a private key instead of a password. ([#11395](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11395))

  ```python
  context.data_sources.add_snowflake(
      name="my_snowflake",
      connection_details={
          "account": "myOrg-my_account",
          "user": "my_user",
          "database": "my_db",
          "schema": "my_schema",
          "warehouse": "my_wh",
          "role": "my_role",
          "private_key": "<PEM-encoded private key>",
      },
  )
  ```

- **Row conditions are honored by Volume Expectations** — Volume Expectations now apply the configured row condition, so expected row counts are evaluated against the filtered rows rather than the whole batch. ([#11467](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11467))

- **Documented schema handling in Redshift and PostgreSQL connection strings** — The connection documentation now explains how to specify a schema in Redshift and PostgreSQL connection strings. ([#11433](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11433))

- **GX Cloud Data Health documentation for failed Expectations** — New GX Cloud documentation covers the Data Health view for failed Expectations, with screenshots refreshed to match the current interface, alongside new GX Cloud architecture supporting content. ([#11419](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11419), [#11458](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11458), [#11439](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11439))

</details>

### 1.7.1 (2025-10-15)

#### Highlights

- **Databricks SQL parameters are now compiled in `unexpected_index_query`** — Validation results for Databricks now return an `unexpected_index_query` with its parameters fully rendered, so the query can be copied and run as-is. The query compilation is also no longer sensitive to unfamiliar bind-parameter patterns or to the ordering of parameter values. ([#11437](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11437))

- **`ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` works against Trino** — `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` now evaluates correctly when validating data in Trino. ([#11438](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11438))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType(column="id", type_="INTEGER")
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Databricks SQL parameters are now compiled into `unexpected_index_query`, so the returned query is complete and runnable, and no longer depends on bind-parameter naming patterns or dictionary ordering. ([#11437](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11437))
- Fixed `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` so it evaluates correctly against Trino. ([#11438](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11438))

##### Docs

- Added documentation for connecting to data in Amazon S3. ([#11375](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11375))
- Clarified in the documentation that a workspace is required. ([#11443](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11443))
- Documented support for Python 3.13. ([#11442](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11442))
- Updated documentation to describe finding the workspace ID in the UI. ([#11435](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11435))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Updated pre-commit hooks to newer versions of pre-commit-hooks and ruff. ([#11355](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11355))
- Type checkers no longer flag passing Redshift connection details when adding or updating a Redshift data source; the type stubs now accept them alongside a connection string. ([#11434](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11434))

</details>

### 1.7.0 (2025-10-09)

Compatibility: Python `<3.13,>=3.9` → `<3.14,>=3.9`; `numpy` added (`python_version >= "3.13"`); `pandas` added (`python_version >= "3.13"`); `posthog` removed; `pandas` removed (extra `snowflake`) (`python_version >= "3.9"`)

#### Highlights

- **Python 3.13 support** — Great Expectations now installs and runs on Python 3.13, in addition to the previously supported 3.9 through 3.12. ([#11426](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11426))

- **Works with pandas 2.2 and newer** — The `<2.2` upper bound on pandas has been removed, so you can install Great Expectations alongside pandas 2.2.0 and later and pick up the newest pandas features and fixes. ([#11423](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11423))

  ```python
  pip install great_expectations "pandas>=2.2"
  ```

- **Usage analytics removed** — Great Expectations no longer collects or sends usage analytics, and the `posthog` dependency is no longer installed with the library. ([#11420](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11420))

- **Reassigning a Snowflake connection string now works as expected** — Setting a new connection string on an existing SQL data source — including Snowflake — is now converted to the proper connection type, so the data source stays usable after the reassignment. ([#11410](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11410))

  ```python
  datasource.connection_string = "snowflake://user:password@account/db/schema?warehouse=wh&role=role"
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added support for running Great Expectations on Python 3.13. ([#11426](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11426))
- The `Renderer` class is no longer part of the public API. ([#10866](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10866))
- Removed the `<2.2` upper bound on pandas so Great Expectations can be used with pandas 2.2.0 and above. ([#11423](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11423))

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed AWS authentication errors at validation time when credentials were supplied to `PandasS3Datasource` through `boto3_options` rather than environment variables. ([#11412](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11412))
- Fixed an issue where assigning a new connection string to a SQL data source after creation — most visibly with Snowflake — left the value in an unusable form. ([#11410](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11410))

##### Docs

- Removed the migration guide from the documentation. ([#11405](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11405))
- Documentation now states that Completeness Anomaly Detection is opt-in. ([#11406](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11406))
- Documentation now states that schedules are opt-in. ([#11408](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11408))

### 1.6.3 (2025-09-24)

Compatibility: new extra `test`

#### Highlights

- **Tutorial for validating unstructured data in GX Cloud** — A new tutorial walks through validating unstructured data in GX Cloud end to end. ([#11380](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11380))

- **Documentation for severity tagging** — The GX Cloud documentation now covers severity tagging, including refreshed screenshots that match the current UI, plus new diagrams illustrating GX integration points. ([#11354](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11354), [#11394](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11394), [#11391](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11391))

</details>

### 1.6.2 (2025-09-19)

Compatibility: `pyarrow` removed (extra `arrow`); new extra `arrow`; new extra `snowflake`; removed extra `snowflake`; `pyarrow` removed (extra `test`); new extra `test`

#### Highlights

- **Expectation reference documentation now describes the severity parameter** — Every Expectation type's reference documentation now lists `severity` under "Other Parameters", with a link to the severity documentation, so you can see how to set failure severity directly from the Expectation reference. ([#11387](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11387))

- **Type-list validation works against Trino** — `ExpectColumnValuesToBeInTypeList` now compares column types correctly when validating data through the Trino dialect, instead of misreporting matching types. ([#11386](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11386))

- **Documentation for workspaces** — The documentation site now covers workspaces. ([#11366](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11366))

#### Changes

- Added documentation covering workspaces. ([#11366](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11366))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Fixed Snowflake dependency resolution on Python 3.10 so installs with Snowflake support succeed. ([#11390](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11390))
- Pinned `pyarrow>=14` for Python 3.12 in the development arrow requirements so Snowflake marker test jobs install a prebuilt wheel instead of failing to build from source; no runtime behavior changes. ([#11388](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11388))

</details>

### 1.6.1 (2025-09-15)

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Users without any associated workspaces — such as the system user used by the runner — no longer hit an error when retrieving cloud user information, so analytics can be logged with no workspaces present. ([#11378](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11378))

### 1.6.0 (2025-09-12)

#### Highlights

- **GX Cloud workspace awareness** — Data Contexts are now workspace aware, laying the groundwork for GX Cloud's multi-workspace support. A workspace id supplied to a Cloud context is carried through to Cloud requests and to the credentials used by its stores. ([#11369](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11369), [#11371](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11371), [#11373](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11373))

  ```python
  # GX_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_ID is read alongside your Cloud access token and organization id
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context(mode="cloud")
  ```

- **S3 data assets read past the first page of results** — Listing files in an S3 directory or bucket with more results than fit in a single response now returns all of them instead of raising an error part-way through. ([#11361](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11361))

- **More robust handling of quoted and mixed-case SQL identifiers** — Schema and table names that are quoted, use data-source-specific quote characters, or use mixed case are now handled correctly when building queries and when collecting column metadata. ([#11367](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11367), [#11365](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11365))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Data Contexts are now workspace aware, adding initial support for GX Cloud's upcoming multi-workspace feature. ([#11369](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11369))

##### Bug fixes

- Reading an S3 directory that spans multiple pages of results no longer fails; the continuation token is no longer reused in subsequent requests. ([#11361](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11361))
- Quoted schema and table names are handled more reliably: the quote characters used by all supported SQL data sources are now recognized, and identifiers are quoted correctly when serialized. ([#11367](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11367))
- Column metadata is now computed correctly for tables whose names use mixed case. ([#11365](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11365))

##### Docs

- Documentation for building custom agent Docker images now recommends the stable base image instead of latest. ([#11353](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11353))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- A Cloud context now passes its workspace id along with the access token and organization id in the credentials used by its stores, and requests for the data context configuration are scoped to the workspace. ([#11371](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11371))
- The Cloud test job in continuous integration now supplies a workspace id, so workspace-aware behavior is exercised in CI. ([#11373](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11373))
- Added test coverage confirming that the unexpected_rows result format option behaves consistently across the canonical column map expectations for Pandas and SQL data sources. ([#11368](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11368))

</details>

#### Contributors

Thanks to @pawel99k (first contribution).

### 1.5.11 (2025-09-04)

#### Highlights

- **Severity-aware Checkpoint notifications** — Expectations that carry a severity value can now be validated and acted on end to end: validation results expose the highest-severity failure they contain, and built-in Checkpoint actions use it to decide whether to notify. ([#11341](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11341), [#11343](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11343), [#11347](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11347))

  ```python
  result = checkpoint.run()
  validation_result = result.run_results[next(iter(result.run_results))]
  max_severity = validation_result.get_max_severity_failure()
  ```

- **Quoted table names stay quoted in GX Cloud** — A table asset whose table name is quoted keeps its quoting when it is sent to and fetched back from GX Cloud, so the name continues to be treated as quoted. ([#11357](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11357))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Validation results expose a new get_max_severity_failure method that reports the highest-severity failing Expectation in the result, which is also used when deciding whether to send notifications. ([#11341](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11341))
- Expectations with a severity value set can now be validated; previously validation failed because the expectation configuration could not be serialized. ([#11343](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11343))
- Built-in Checkpoint actions now take Expectation severity into account when deciding whether to send a notification. ([#11347](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11347))

##### Bug fixes

- Quoted table names on a table asset keep their quotes when the asset is serialized for GX Cloud, so a fetched asset is still treated as having a quoted table name. ([#11357](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11357))
- Unexpected rows are now included in validation results whenever they are requested. ([#11358](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11358))

##### Docs

- Added GX Cloud documentation for the built-in validation actions. ([#11338](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11338))

### 1.5.9 (2025-08-20)

#### Highlights

- **Expectation JSON schemas now carry failure severity** — Expectations can express a failure severity, and the published JSON schemas now include the new `severity` field backed by a `FailureSeverity` enum. ([#11337](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11337))

- **Documentation for Cloud API version 0.18 sunset** — The compatibility reference and related documentation now reflect the sunset of Cloud API version 0.18. ([#11334](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11334))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Expectation JSON schemas now include a `severity` field, with a new `FailureSeverity` enum describing Expectation failure severity. ([#11337](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11337))

</details>

### 1.5.8 (2025-08-07)

#### Highlights

- **Validations against Databricks no longer fail on large bundled metric queries** — Metric queries that exceed Databricks' 256 query-parameter limit are now split into smaller batches automatically, so validating batches with many parameters against Databricks completes instead of erroring. ([#11317](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11317))

- **Documentation for retrying Expectation generation with your own input** — The documentation now describes the retry workflows for supplying user input when generating Expectations, so you can guide generation when the first attempt isn't what you wanted. ([#11325](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11325))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Bundled metric queries are now split into batches when they would exceed Databricks' 256 query-parameter limit, so validations no longer fail on that limit. ([#11317](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11317))

##### Docs

- Documented the retry workflows for providing user input during Expectation generation. ([#11325](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11325))

### 1.5.7 (2025-07-30)

#### Highlights

- **Spark Connect and Databricks shared clusters now supported for column comparisons** — Expectations that reference columns on Spark now build those references in a way Spark Connect accepts, so validations that previously failed with "[CANNOT_RESOLVE_DATAFRAME_COLUMN] Cannot resolve dataframe column" on Spark Connect and Databricks shared clusters now run correctly. Expectations such as ExpectColumnValueLengthsToBeBetween and ExpectColumnPairValuesAToBeGreaterThanB are fixed; behavior on local Spark is unchanged. ([#11286](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11286))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed Spark column references so expectations no longer fail with "Cannot resolve dataframe column" on Spark Connect and Databricks shared clusters. ([#11286](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11286))

### 1.5.6 (2025-07-24)

#### Highlights

- **New documentation for Data Health, SQL generation, and pipeline architecture** — The docs now cover the Data Health dashboard (including a screenshot of it), generating SQL, the newly supported data sources, and a pipeline architecture diagram. ([#11294](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11294), [#11307](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11307), [#11289](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11289), [#11293](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11293), [#11298](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11298))

- **Range expectations reject incompatible date and datetime bounds** — ExpectColumnUniqueValueCountToBeBetween, ExpectColumnStdevToBeBetween, and ExpectColumnValueLengthsToBeBetween no longer accept date or datetime values for their min and max inputs, so these expectations now only allow bounds that make sense for the value they measure. ([#11305](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11305))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- ExpectColumnUniqueValueCountToBeBetween, ExpectColumnStdevToBeBetween, and ExpectColumnValueLengthsToBeBetween no longer accept date or datetime values for their min and max inputs. ([#11305](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11305))

- Added scheduled clean-up scripts for Databricks and Snowflake test schemas. ([#11297](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11297))

</details>

### 1.5.5 (2025-07-10)

#### Highlights

- **BigQuery data source** — A dedicated BigQuery data source class is now available, so BigQuery connections can be declared as their own data source type rather than as a generic SQL connection. ([#11296](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11296))

- **Postgres-compatible data source flavors** — New data source classes cover Postgres-compatible services — Google Cloud AlloyDB, Amazon Aurora, Citus, and Neon — so each of these backends can be selected directly when connecting to data. ([#11290](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11290))

- **Disabling analytics is now fully respected** — When analytics is disabled in the Data Context configuration, analytics initialization is no longer performed at all. This resolves permission-denied errors raised while looking for a user-level configuration file in restricted environments such as Databricks streaming jobs. ([#11276](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11276))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added a BigQuery data source class for connecting to BigQuery. ([#11296](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11296))
- Added Postgres-compatible data source classes for Google Cloud AlloyDB, Amazon Aurora, Citus, and Neon. ([#11290](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11290))

##### Bug fixes

- Analytics initialization is now skipped entirely when analytics is disabled in the Data Context configuration, avoiding permission-denied errors from looking up a user-level configuration file. ([#11276](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11276))

##### Docs

- Corrected an inaccurate statement about forecasted ranges in the documentation. ([#11295](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11295))

### 1.5.4 (2025-07-02)

#### Highlights

- **Corrected result summary for ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet** — Validation results for ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet now render correctly, so the expectation's summary reads accurately wherever results are displayed. ([#11281](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11281))

- **New documentation for Anomaly Detection expectations** — The docs now cover the Anomaly Detection expectation drawer and its underlying model, so you can understand how anomaly detection expectations are configured and how they behave. ([#11234](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11234))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed the rendering of ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet so its results display correctly. ([#11281](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11281))
- Generalized the schema expectation so it behaves correctly across a wider range of inputs. ([#11272](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11272))

##### Docs

- Clarified the integration support policy documentation and renamed the "resources" section to "help". ([#11247](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11247))
- Added documentation for the Anomaly Detection expectation drawer and the anomaly detection model. ([#11234](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11234))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Snowflake and Databricks integration tests now use the shared data-source parameterization helper instead of the table factory fixture, with no change to library behavior. ([#11277](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11277))
- Upgraded the ruff linter used for development to 0.12.0. ([#11263](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11263))
- Snowflake end-to-end Cloud tests now use the shared data-source parameterization decorator for connection pooling and table setup and teardown, with no change to library behavior. ([#11274](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11274))

</details>

### 1.5.3 (2025-06-25)

#### Highlights

- **ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet now matches column names case-insensitively** — On SQL dialects where column names are compared case-insensitively (PostgreSQL, Databricks SQL, and Snowflake), ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet no longer fails when the expected column set differs only by letter casing from the table's actual columns. It now behaves consistently with the other column-name expectations such as expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list and expect_column_to_exist. ([#11266](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11266))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  # Passes against a table whose columns are PASSENGER_COUNT and TRIP_DISTANCE
  suite.add_expectation(
      gxe.ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet(column_set=["passenger_count", "trip_distance"])
  )
  ```

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet now compares column names case-insensitively on dialects that treat column names as case-insensitive, so expectations no longer fail purely because of letter casing. ([#11266](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11266))

##### Docs

- Added documentation for the ExpectColumnProportionOfNonNullValuesToBeBetween expectation. ([#11257](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11257))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Widened the supported posthog dependency range to allow versions 4 and 5. ([#11265](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11265))

</details>

### 1.5.2 (2025-06-18)

#### Highlights

- **Suite parameters accepted in every expectation argument** — All expectation arguments now accept suite parameters, so any keyword argument of an expectation can be supplied at validation time instead of being hard-coded when the expectation is defined. ([#11222](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11222))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  expectation = gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(
      column="passenger_count",
      min_value={"$PARAMETER": "min_passengers"},
      max_value={"$PARAMETER": "max_passengers"},
  )

  results = batch.validate(
      expectation,
      expectation_parameters={"min_passengers": 1, "max_passengers": 6},
  )
  ```

- **Whole-directory batch definitions read every file again** — Batch definitions created with `add_batch_definition_whole_directory` on S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage data assets now read all files in the directory instead of only one. ([#11254](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11254))

  ```python
  asset = data_source.add_directory_csv_asset(name="my_asset", s3_prefix="data/")
  batch_definition = asset.add_batch_definition_whole_directory("all_files")
  batch = batch_definition.get_batch()
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Every expectation argument now accepts a suite parameter, so all expectation keyword arguments can be parameterized and supplied at validation time. ([#11222](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11222))

##### Bug fixes

- The `min_value` and `max_value` parameters of `ExpectColumnProportionOfNonNullValuesToBeBetween` and `ExpectColumnProportionOfUniqueValuesToBeBetween` no longer accept date or datetime values; they now accept only numbers (or a suite parameter), and their published schemas reflect this. ([#11259](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11259))
- Fixed `add_batch_definition_whole_directory` reading only a single file for S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage data assets; the whole directory is now read as one batch. ([#11254](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11254))
- Fixed a `ValidationError` raised when using `ExpectColumnPairValuesToHaveDifferenceOfCustomPercentage`; the expectation now declares its required `percentage` argument. ([#11209](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11209))

##### Docs

- Added a tip about Cloud API data sources to the documentation. ([#11248](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11248))
- Temporarily disabled the documentation link checker while changed page paths are sorted out. ([#11250](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11250))

</details>

#### Contributors

### 1.5.1 (2025-06-11)

#### Highlights

- **New expectation: ExpectColumnProportionOfUniqueValuesToBeBetween** — You can now assert that the proportion of unique values in a column falls within an expected range, letting you catch columns that become unexpectedly duplicated or unexpectedly high-cardinality. ([#11235](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11235))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  expectation = gxe.ExpectColumnProportionOfUniqueValuesToBeBetween(
      column="passenger_count",
      min_value=0.1,
      max_value=0.9,
  )
  ```

- **Non-null count available as a column metric** — A column aggregate metric for the number of non-null values in a column is now available, so expectations and custom checks can reason about how much data a column actually contains. ([#11229](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11229))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added `ExpectColumnProportionOfUniqueValuesToBeBetween`, which validates that the proportion of unique values in a column falls between a minimum and maximum value. ([#11235](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11235))
- Added a `ColumnAggregateNonNullCount` metric that reports the number of non-null values in a column. ([#11229](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11229))

##### Docs

- Fixed a documentation link that pointed at content removed in an earlier change. ([#11232](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11232))
- Revised documentation wording around the term "API" for consistency with the current style guidance. ([#11196](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11196))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Removed the Rule-Based Profiler and its references, moving the column-filtering behavior it provided into a standalone module. ([#11231](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11231))
- Restored database connection pooling in the expectation test suite, including cleanup of the temporary schemas the tests create. ([#11228](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11228))
- Reverted a change that gated Snowflake tests behind a `--snowflake` flag, so those tests run again in CI via the `snowflake` marker. ([#11230](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11230))

</details>

### 1.5.0 (2025-06-05)

#### Highlights

- **Multi-source Expectations documentation** — The documentation now covers Multi-source Expectations, explaining how to compare data across two different data sources. ([#11165](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11165))

- **Redshift geometry and super column types supported** — Redshift data sources now recognize the `GEOMETRY` and `SUPER` column types, so assets containing these columns can be introspected and validated. ([#11194](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11194))

- **No more pkg_resources dependency** — GX Core no longer depends on the deprecated `pkg_resources` package, removing its import-time deprecation warnings on modern Python installs. ([#11213](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11213))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added support for the Redshift `GEOMETRY` and `SUPER` column types. ([#11194](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11194))

##### Docs

### 1.4.6 (2025-05-28)

#### Highlights

- **Clearer errors for unhashable column types in ExpectQueryResultsToMatchComparison** — When a query returns unhashable data types such as JSONB, ExpectQueryResultsToMatchComparison now raises a helpful error that names the first column containing unhashable data instead of failing with an unclear message. ([#11193](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11193))

- **Case-insensitive column type checks on Databricks, Snowflake, and Postgres** — expect_column_values_to_be_of_type now treats unquoted identifiers in column_name and column_type as case-insensitive on Databricks, Postgres, and Snowflake, so type expectations pass regardless of the casing you write. ([#11192](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11192))

  ```python
  suite.add_expectation(
      gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType(column="my_column", type_="varchar")
  )
  ```

- **Documentation for anomaly detection** — The documentation now covers anomaly detection, alongside refreshed wording for the terms "Core" and "platform" and updated guidance noting that both tables and views are supported as data assets. ([#11172](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11172), [#11187](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11187), [#11198](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11198), [#11205](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11205))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- UUID values are now handled correctly when rendering expectation content. ([#11204](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11204))
- Rendering of ExpectQueryResultsToMatchComparison now handles cases where results contain sets. ([#11203](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11203))
- expect_column_values_to_be_of_type now treats unquoted column names and column types as case-insensitive on Databricks, Postgres, and Snowflake. ([#11192](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11192))
- ExpectQueryResultsToMatchComparison now raises a clear error naming the first column with unhashable data (for example JSONB) instead of failing unhelpfully. ([#11193](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11193))

##### Docs

- Revised how the term "Core" is used in relation to GX Cloud throughout the documentation. ([#11205](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11205))
- Data Source connection and Expectation docs now state that views are supported in addition to tables. ([#11198](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11198))

### 1.4.5 (2025-05-22)

#### Highlights

- **Redshift GEOMETRY and SUPER column types supported** — Redshift data sources now recognize the GEOMETRY and SUPER column types, so assets using those columns can be used without an unsupported-type error. ([#11183](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11183))

- **ExpectAI documentation now covers all Data Sources** — The ExpectAI documentation has been reorganized so it applies to every supported Data Source rather than a subset. ([#11178](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11178))

- **Fewer secret-store lookups when resolving config secrets** — Secret substitution now reuses a cached secrets store client instead of rebuilding it on every lookup, avoiding repeated calls to the secrets backend when loading configuration. ([#11184](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11184))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Redshift data sources now support the GEOMETRY and SUPER column types. ([#11183](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11183))

##### Bug fixes

- Secret lookups now reuse the existing cached secrets store client rather than recreating it for each substitution. ([#11184](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11184))

##### Docs

- Updated the ExpectAI documentation to cover all Data Sources. ([#11178](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11178))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- When a multi-source query comparison produces exactly one differing record in a single column, the validation result now renders the observed and expected values as plain single values instead of a table. ([#11186](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11186))
- Renamed the multi-source Expectation to ExpectQueryResultsToMatchComparison and renamed its parameters to base_query, comparison_data_source_name, and comparison_query. ([#11185](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11185))

### 1.4.4 (2025-05-14)

#### Highlights

- **New Expectation: ExpectQueryResultsToMatchSource** — You can now compare the results of a SQL query run against your Data Source with the results of a query run against another Data Source, and require that at least a `mostly` fraction of records match. Supported on PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Databricks (SQL), Redshift, and SQLite. ([#11144](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11144))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  expectation = gx.expectations.ExpectQueryResultsToMatchSource(
      target_query="SELECT id, amount FROM orders",
      source_data_source_name="my_source_data_source",
      source_query="SELECT id, amount FROM orders",
      mostly=0.95,
  )
  ```

- **Richer results and rendering for ExpectQueryResultsToMatchSource** — Validation results for ExpectQueryResultsToMatchSource now report the specific rows missing from or unexpected in the target query results, and those differences are presented as a diagnostic table — with a simplified presentation when the source and target queries each return a single column. The Expectation also renders a readable summary showing the target query and the source Data Source it is compared against. ([#11161](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11161), [#11168](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11168), [#11173](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11173), [#11160](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11160))

</details>

### 1.4.2 (2025-04-24)

#### Highlights

- **Redshift connection strings can be supplied as a dictionary** — When adding a Redshift datasource, `connection_string` may now be given as a dictionary of connection components in addition to a string URL. ([#11119](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11119))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  datasource = context.data_sources.add_redshift(
      name="my_redshift",
      connection_string={
          "drivername": "redshift+psycopg2",
          "username": "my_user",
          "password": "my_password",
          "host": "my-cluster.redshift.amazonaws.com",
          "port": 5439,
          "database": "my_database",
      },
  )
  ```

- **Expectation coverage for Redshift assets** — Expectations running against Redshift assets are now verified to the same level as Postgres, so Redshift users can rely on the same set of expectations behaving as documented. ([#11128](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11128))

- **More type information shipped with the package** — The published distribution now exposes more of the library's type information, so type checkers resolve Great Expectations types in your own code more completely. ([#11115](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11115))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Expectations against Redshift assets are now covered to parity with Postgres. ([#11128](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11128))
- Redshift datasources now accept a `connection_string` provided as a dictionary in addition to a string. ([#11119](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11119))

</details>

### 1.4.1 (2025-04-21)

#### Highlights

- **New `ColumnDescriptiveStats` metric** — You can now compute a column's minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation in a single metric with `ColumnDescriptiveStats`, available on the pandas, SQL, and Spark backends. ([#11108](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11108), [#11109](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11109))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.metrics import ColumnDescriptiveStats

  result = batch.compute_metrics(ColumnDescriptiveStats(column="passenger_count"))
  print(result.value.min, result.value.max, result.value.mean, result.value.standard_deviation)
  ```

- **New `ColumnValuesNotMatchRegexCount` metric** — You can now count the values in a column that do not match a regular expression with `ColumnValuesNotMatchRegexCount`, available on the pandas, SQL, and Spark backends. ([#11103](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11103))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.metrics import ColumnValuesNotMatchRegexCount

  result = batch.compute_metrics(
      ColumnValuesNotMatchRegexCount(column="vendor_id", regex="^(a|d).+")
  )
  print(result.value)
  ```

- **Connect to Redshift with connection details** — A Redshift data source can now be configured by supplying individual connection details instead of a full connection string. ([#11105](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11105))

- **Redshift schema introspection no longer raises a TypeError** — Using the `gx-redshift` extra to introspect schema information, such as computing column descriptive metrics, no longer fails with a runtime `TypeError`. ([#11112](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11112))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added the `ColumnDescriptiveStats` metric, which returns a column's minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation on pandas, SQL, and Spark backends. ([#11108](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11108))
- Redshift data sources can now be configured with individual connection details in addition to a `connection_string`. ([#11105](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11105))

### 1.4.0 (2025-04-15)

Compatibility: new extra `gx-redshift`

#### Highlights

- **Redshift support via a new `gx-redshift` extra** — Great Expectations can now be installed with Redshift support through a dedicated extra, and Redshift is listed among the supported data sources for the expectations that run against it. ([#11092](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11092), [#11084](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11084), [#11094](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11094))

  ```python
  pip install 'great_expectations[gx-redshift]'
  ```

- **SQLAlchemy 2.x support for BigQuery** — The BigQuery extra now works with SQLAlchemy 2.x as well as 1.x, so you can install great_expectations[bigquery] in a SQLAlchemy 2.x environment. ([#11059](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11059))

  ```python
  pip install 'great_expectations[bigquery]'
  ```

- **New column metrics for sampling and regex counts** — You can compute a sample of values from a column and a count of values matching a regular expression directly from a batch. ([#11083](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11083), [#11091](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11091))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.metrics.column.column_values_match_regex_count import (
      ColumnValuesMatchRegexCount,
  )

  metric = ColumnValuesMatchRegexCount(column="my_column", regex="ab")
  result = batch.compute_metrics(metric)
  ```

- **Sets and tuples accepted for `value_set`** — Expectations such as ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet now accept sets and tuples for `value_set` instead of failing validation; these inputs are coerced to lists automatically. ([#11082](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11082))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.expectations import ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet

  expectation = ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet(
      column="country_name_en",
      value_set={"UNITED STATES", "CHINA", "SPAIN"},
  )
  ```

- **`get_context` honors `context_root_dir`** — Requesting a file-backed Data Context with an explicit root directory now creates and loads the context in that directory. ([#11078](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11078))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context(mode="file", context_root_dir="/path/to/my/project")
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Add a ColumnValuesMatchRegexCount metric that reports how many column values match a given regular expression, available on Pandas, SQL, and Spark batches. ([#11091](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11091))
- Add a `gx-redshift` install extra so Redshift dependencies can be installed with `pip install 'great_expectations[gx-redshift]'`. ([#11092](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11092))
- List Redshift among the supported data sources for the expectations that are verified against Redshift. ([#11084](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11084))
- Add a ColumnSampleValues metric for retrieving a sample of values from a column. ([#11083](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11083))
- The BigQuery extra now supports SQLAlchemy 2.x as well as 1.x, requiring sqlalchemy-bigquery 1.11.0 or newer. ([#11059](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11059))

##### Bug fixes

- Expectations that take a `value_set`, such as ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet, no longer fail validation when given a set or tuple; such inputs are coerced to a list (strings and bytes excluded). ([#11082](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11082))
- `get_context` now respects `context_root_dir` when scaffolding and reloading a file-backed Data Context, and the overload accepts `mode="file"` together with `context_root_dir`. ([#11078](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11078))

##### Docs

- Correct the outdated default Great Expectations directory named in a docstring. ([#11077](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11077))
- Update the scheduling instructions to match the current user interface. ([#11080](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11080))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Run the gx-sqlalchemy-redshift test suite in continuous integration. ([#11094](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11094))
- Add a ColumnValuesNotMatchRegexValues metric that returns a sample of column values that do not match a given regular expression. ([#11096](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11096))
- Add a ColumnValuesMatchRegexValues metric that returns a sample of column values matching a regular expression, rather than a pass/fail column map result. ([#11088](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11088))
- Narrow the return type of `compute_metrics` when called with a single metric, so the result type is known without extra casting. ([#11089](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11089))
- Add a ColumnDistinctValues metric that returns the distinct values found in a column. ([#11081](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11081))
- Improve PostHog pageview tracking on the documentation site by disabling automatic capture and tracking single-page navigation instead, removing duplicate pageviews. ([#11087](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11087))
- Revert the earlier gx-redshift extra, which pointed at a direct GitHub dependency and blocked uploading the release to PyPI. ([#11079](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11079))
- Add a ColumnNullCount metric that reports the number of null values in a column. ([#11073](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11073))
- Add a ColumnDistinctValuesCount metric that reports the number of distinct values in a column. ([#11075](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11075))

</details>

### 1.3.14 (2025-04-08)

Compatibility: `sqlalchemy` minimum set to 1.4.0 (extra `bigquery`); `sqlalchemy` minimum set to 1.4.0 (extra `gcp`)

#### Highlights

- **New `gx-redshift` extra for Redshift users** — Great Expectations can now be installed with a dedicated Redshift extra, `pip install great_expectations[gx-redshift]`, which pulls in a Redshift driver compatible with newer SQLAlchemy versions. Note that installing both `redshift` and `gx-redshift` together will fail to resolve, because their SQLAlchemy requirements do not overlap. ([#11063](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11063))

  ```python
  pip install great_expectations[gx-redshift]
  ```

- **`ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` corrected and SQLAlchemy 2 compatible** — `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` now reports the correct result and works against SQLAlchemy 2 backends. ([#11062](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11062))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  suite.add_expectation(
      gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType(column="passenger_count", type_="INTEGER")
  )
  ```

- **Cleaner autocompletion for the top-level `gx` namespace** — Importing `great_expectations as gx` no longer suggests the recursive `gx.great_expectations` attribute in IDE autocompletion, so the public API is easier to navigate. Accessing `gx.great_expectations` now raises an `AttributeError`, while `gx.get_context`, `gx.data_context`, `gx.core`, `gx.ExpectationSuite` and the rest of the intended public API remain available. ([#11070](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11070))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()  # still available; gx.great_expectations is not
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added a `gx-redshift` extra so Redshift support can be installed with `pip install great_expectations[gx-redshift]`; installing it alongside the older `redshift` extra will fail to resolve due to non-overlapping SQLAlchemy requirements. ([#11063](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11063))
- Fixed `ExpectColumnValuesToBeOfType` and made it work with SQLAlchemy 2. ([#11062](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11062))

##### Bug fixes

- Row conditions containing 8-bit characters such as é, ü and ï are now confirmed to parse correctly, covered by a new test. ([#11053](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11053))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Added a `BatchColumnTypes` metric for reporting the column types of a batch. ([#11069](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11069))
- Importing `great_expectations as gx` no longer exposes a recursive `gx.great_expectations` attribute, improving IDE autocompletion; accessing it now raises an `AttributeError` while the rest of the public API is unchanged. ([#11070](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11070))
- Documentation site analytics now use the PostHog Docusaurus plugin to capture default pageviews and events. ([#11060](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11060))

</details>

### 1.3.13 (2025-04-03)

#### Highlights

- **Amazon Redshift data source support** — You can now connect to Amazon Redshift with a dedicated Redshift data source, alongside the existing SQL data sources. ([#11011](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11011))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added an initial Amazon Redshift datasource so you can connect Great Expectations directly to Redshift. ([#11011](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11011))

##### Bug fixes

- Prevented SQLite-specific metric implementations from overriding the default SQLAlchemy implementations, so metrics resolve correctly on other SQL backends. This issue was never present in a published release. ([#11055](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11055))

##### Docs

- Updated the coverage health screenshot in the documentation. ([#11057](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11057))
- Follow-up corrections to the completeness change detection documentation. ([#11056](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11056))
- Added documentation for completeness change detection. ([#11039](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11039))
- Expanded the test coverage metrics documentation with a reference table. ([#11046](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11046))
- Clarified which roles can create Data Sources and updated the metrics page to reflect the removal of the asset info card. ([#11052](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11052))
- Documented that ExpectAI supports only Snowflake Data Sources using password authentication; key-pair authentication is not yet available. ([#11047](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11047))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Internal metric registry now resolves metric providers through a single internal lookup path; no user-facing change. ([#11044](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11044))

</details>

### 1.3.12 (2025-03-26)

#### Changes

##### Docs

- Corrected the documentation for ExpectColumnKLDivergenceToBeLessThan so its Expectation Gallery entry shows the details already present in the codebase. ([#11040](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11040))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Added internal SQLite execution engine support along with one SQLite-specific metric. ([#11042](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11042))
- Accepted an additional title tag in the pull request title check for contributors. ([#10841](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10841))

</details>

### 1.3.11 (2025-03-19)

#### Highlights

- **Run checkpoints that use Cloud windowed expectations** — Checkpoints can now be run against suites containing GX Cloud windowed expectations, so validations whose thresholds are derived from a window of past results execute as expected. ([#11027](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11027))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context(mode="cloud")
  checkpoint = context.checkpoints.get("my_checkpoint")
  result = checkpoint.run()
  ```

- **Distinct values expectations handle dates and datetimes correctly** — Expectations that compare a column's distinct values against a value set now compare correctly when the data holds dates or datetimes but the expectation was configured with string values. Both the validation result and the observed value shown in rendered diagnostic output now report matching values as expected instead of flagging them as unexpected. ([#11030](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11030), [#11033](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11033))

  ```python
  import datetime

  import great_expectations as gx

  expectation = gx.expectations.ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet(
      column="col A",
      value_set=[str(datetime.date(2024, 11, 19)), str(datetime.date(2024, 11, 20))],
  )
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- Checkpoints can now be run with GX Cloud windowed expectations. ([#11027](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11027))

##### Bug fixes

- ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToContainSet, ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet, and ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet now validate correctly when the column holds dates or datetimes and the value set is given as strings. ([#11030](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11030))

##### Docs

- Corrected an error in the filesystem data source documentation that led to a regex compile error when adding a batch definition path. ([#11019](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11019))
- Expectations previously listed under both Numeric and Validity are now documented under Validity only. ([#11008](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11008))
- Restored the documentation link checker after a temporary workaround. ([#11025](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11025))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Rendered diagnostic observed values for distinct-values expectations now compare dates and datetimes correctly when the configured value set was stored as strings, so matching values are no longer shown as unexpected. ([#11033](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11033))
- Test suites now point at AWS buckets in the open-source account. ([#11034](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11034))
- Added AWS credentials to the continuous integration configuration. ([#11037](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11037))
- Reverted the continuous integration change that switched AWS credential secrets, restoring the previous secret variable names. ([#11036](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11036))
- Updated the AWS secret variable names used by continuous integration (later reverted in this same release). ([#11035](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11035))
- Removed the timber entry from CODEOWNERS. ([#10996](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10996))
- Updated the continuous integration workflow so pull request targets are treated as pull-request-event targets. ([#11031](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11031))
- The context mode is now included in the properties sent with analytics events. ([#11001](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11001))
- Removed the default role applied when connecting to Snowflake. ([#11004](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11004))

</details>

### 1.3.10 (2025-03-12)

#### Highlights

- **Docs reference cards render correctly** — The cards at the top of the docs reference page no longer show stray characters, and the documentation site now builds on the latest Docusaurus with upgraded transitive dependencies that resolve reported vulnerabilities. ([#11009](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11009))

- **Outdated walkthrough modal removed from Data Docs** — Data Docs no longer opens a walkthrough modal that pointed to the deprecated CLI and workflows that are no longer recommended. ([#11022](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11022))

#### Changes

##### Docs

- Added documentation covering test coverage metrics. ([#11002](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11002))
- Applied the new beta badge styling to an additional documentation header. ([#11015](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11015))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Raised the MySQL max_connections setting used by the test environment so more MySQL-backed tests can run. ([#11023](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11023))
- Removed the outdated walkthrough modal from Data Docs, which referenced the deprecated CLI and workflows that are no longer recommended. ([#11022](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11022))
- Simplified CI failure notifications so skipped jobs no longer trigger alerts. ([#11021](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11021))
- Upgraded documentation site dependencies to the latest Docusaurus, removed the unused local search plugin, and fixed stray characters rendered in the cards on the docs reference page. ([#11009](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11009))
- Removed the Numeric data quality issue tag from validity expectations, which are now categorized under Validity only. ([#11005](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11005))
- Removed redundant tests that are already covered by dedicated test files. ([#11007](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/11007))
- Refactored a number of tests to share a common data context fixture. ([#10997](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10997))

</details>

### 1.3.9 (2025-03-05)

Compatibility: `pandas-gbq` added (extra `bigquery`); `pandas-gbq` added (extra `gcp`)

#### Highlights

- **Clearer error when checking value ranges on non-numeric columns** — Running ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween against a column whose underlying type is not numeric or datetime (for example a SQL VARCHAR column) now raises an explicit, actionable Great Expectations error instead of an opaque database exception that could also cause every other expectation in the same run to fail. ([#10995](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10995))

- **New metrics: query row count, column-pair, and multi-column** — The metrics API gains QueryRowCount, ColumnPairValuesInSetUnexpectedCount, and MultiColumnSumEqualUnexpectedCount, extending the typed metrics you can compute directly against a batch. ([#10964](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10964), [#10969](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10969), [#10973](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10973))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.metrics import QueryRowCount

  metric = QueryRowCount(query="SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE passenger_count > 2")
  result = batch.compute_metrics(metric)
  ```

- **More reliable batch.compute_metrics results** — batch.compute_metrics no longer drops results when two metrics share a name, computes distinct configuration IDs per batch, and always returns a list of results when a list of metrics is passed — so the number of results always matches the number of metrics requested. ([#10979](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10979))

- **Cleaner Slack notification messages** — Slack validation notifications no longer repeat the link text, highlight the asset and expectation suite names in Markdown for easier scanning, and once again include a summary of how many expectations passed out of the total. ([#10890](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10890))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added the first multi-column metric, MultiColumnSumEqualUnexpectedCount, along with multi-column metric support including column_list, row_condition, condition_parser, and ignore_row_if options. ([#10973](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10973))
- Added the first column-pair metric, ColumnPairValuesInSetUnexpectedCount, with test coverage. ([#10969](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10969))
- Added a QueryRowCount metric for computing the number of rows returned by a query. ([#10964](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10964))
- Removed the batch_id parameter from Metric classes, so metrics are defined without specifying a batch. ([#10971](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10971))

##### Bug fixes

- ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween now raises a clear error when run against a column whose type is not numeric or datetime, instead of surfacing an opaque database exception. ([#10995](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10995))
- Batch definitions returned by Asset.get_batch_definition now always include their ID. ([#10986](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10986))
- Fixed batch.compute_metrics so identically named metrics no longer overwrite each other, configuration IDs differ per batch, and passing a list of metrics always returns a list of results of matching length. ([#10979](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10979))
- ValidationDefinition add_or_update can now update a batch definition that belongs to a different data source instead of failing unexpectedly. ([#10960](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10960))

##### Docs

- API reference code blocks now place each method parameter on its own line for easier reading. ([#10985](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10985))
- Updated the documentation site search key to fix broken search. ([#10994](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10994))
- Custom action documentation now shows how to define a user-defined field on an action so runtime values can be passed through to custom run logic. ([#10987](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10987))
- Added documentation covering volume change detection. ([#10927](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10927))
- Temporarily disabled the documentation link checker while a known issue is resolved. ([#10992](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10992))
- Fixed the formatting of the parameters for the ValidationDefinition run method in the API reference. ([#10981](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10981))
- Added a README to the docs scripts folder explaining how to run the API reference link-versioning script. ([#10982](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10982))
- Documentation pages can now show a beta badge on a section, visible both in the heading and the table of contents. ([#10980](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10980))
- Added a script that rewrites API reference links with an explicit docs version after a new documentation version is cut, so archived links no longer break. ([#10976](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10976))
- API reference pages now show a heading above each method's code block. ([#10970](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10970))
- Made the Airflow provider easier to discover in the documentation. ([#10967](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10967))

### 1.3.8 (2025-02-26)

#### Highlights

- **Compute metrics directly from a Batch** — Batches now expose a `compute_metrics()` method, so you can request one or more metrics for a batch and get back typed results without assembling a validation run. ([#10950](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10950))

  ```python
  batch = batch_definition.get_batch()
  results = batch.compute_metrics([ColumnMean(column="passenger_count")])
  ```

- **New metrics: column mean and non-null counts** — The metrics API now includes a mean metric along with `ColumnValuesNonNull` and `ColumnValuesNonNullCount`, so you can measure column averages and how many values in a column are populated. ([#10961](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10961), [#10959](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10959))

  ```python
  batch.compute_metrics([ColumnValuesNonNullCount(column="passenger_count")])
  ```

- **API reference arguments, returns, and raises now render as tables** — API reference pages present a method's arguments, return values, and raised exceptions in readable tables, and every argument and raised exception is listed instead of only the first one. ([#10910](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10910), [#10968](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10968))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added a mean metric to the metrics API, so column averages can be requested directly. ([#10961](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10961))
- Added `ColumnValuesNonNull` and `ColumnValuesNonNullCount` metrics for inspecting which column values are populated and how many there are. ([#10959](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10959))
- Added `Batch.compute_metrics()` for requesting metrics from a batch, with typed metric results. ([#10950](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10950))

##### Docs

- API reference pages now list every entry under Args and Raises instead of showing only a single row, so documented arguments and exceptions are no longer lost. ([#10968](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10968))
- Fixed a typo in the documentation. ([#10965](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10965))
- API reference pages now display arguments, returns, and raises as tables instead of plain bulleted text. ([#10910](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10910))
- Added a single sign-on call to action to the Cloud user management documentation. ([#10872](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10872))

### 1.3.7 (2025-02-19)

Compatibility: `jinja2` minimum 2.10 → 3

#### Highlights

- **New batch-level row count metric** — A new `BatchRowCount` metric computes the number of rows in a batch and works against pandas, Spark, and SQL (Postgres) data sources. Its result is returned as a typed `BatchRowCountResult`, alongside a new `Batch` metric domain for metrics that compute over an entire batch. ([#10944](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10944))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.metrics.batch.batch import BatchRowCount

  metric = BatchRowCount(batch_id=batch.id)
  ```

- **Quieter metric resolution** — Batch and column-map expectations no longer carry an unused `table` domain key, so resolving metrics no longer emits a flood of unnecessary log messages. ([#10951](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10951))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added the `BatchRowCount` metric and its `BatchRowCountResult`, plus a `Batch` metric domain, for computing row counts over an entire batch on pandas, Spark, and SQL data sources. ([#10944](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10944))

##### Bug fixes

- Removed the unused `table` domain key from batch and column-map expectations, eliminating the noisy log messages it produced during metric resolution. ([#10951](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10951))

##### Docs

- Documentation search configuration now uses environment variables in place of hardcoded search keys. ([#10940](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10940))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Metric classes now require an explicit `name` rather than having one inferred from the class and domain names, making metric naming predictable. ([#10953](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10953))
- Dropped support for jinja2 2.x; great_expectations now requires jinja2 3 or newer. ([#10941](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10941))
- `Metric.config` can no longer be instantiated directly and is hidden from editor auto-complete. ([#10938](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10938))

</details>

### 1.3.6 (2025-02-14)

#### Highlights

- **ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween works again with runtime parameters** — Creating or running ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween with `min_value` or `max_value` supplied as runtime parameters no longer fails validation. Values are only compared to each other when both are concrete; a parameter dictionary is instead checked for a `$PARAMETER` key. ([#10925](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10925))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween(
      min_value={"$PARAMETER": "min_rows"},
      max_value={"$PARAMETER": "max_rows"},
  )
  ```

- **Snowflake connections accept passwords with special characters** — Passwords are now URL-quoted before the Snowflake connection URL is built, so credentials containing special characters connect successfully. ([#10919](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10919))

- **Unexpected rows queries tolerate trailing whitespace and semicolons** — An unexpected rows query that ends with trailing whitespace or a `;` is now trimmed and accepted instead of being rejected. ([#10923](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10923))

  ```python
  gxe.UnexpectedRowsExpectation(
      unexpected_rows_query="SELECT * FROM {batch} WHERE passenger_count > 6;"
  )
  ```

- **Clear error when cloud mode is requested without credentials** — Requesting a cloud context without the required environment variables now produces the intended, explicit error message instead of an opaque message about the Data Context being `None`. ([#10916](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10916))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context(mode="cloud")
  ```

- **Documentation for AI-recommended Expectations** — The GX Cloud documentation now covers AI-recommended Expectations. ([#10913](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10913))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween can again be created and run when `min_value` or `max_value` is supplied as a runtime parameter; the min/max comparison is only applied when both values are concrete, and parameter dictionaries are validated for a `$PARAMETER` key. ([#10925](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10925))
- Fixed an incorrect import in the diagnostic checklist test that pulled from the test package. ([#10934](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10934))
- Metric configuration identifiers are now immutable, preventing identifiers from changing partway through metric computation. ([#10929](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10929))
- Unexpected rows queries with trailing whitespace or a trailing `;` are now trimmed and accepted. ([#10923](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10923))
- Snowflake passwords are URL-quoted when building the connection URL, so passwords containing special characters no longer prevent connecting. ([#10919](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10919))

##### Docs

- Restored a missing test mock for the documentation site's location hook so the "Was this helpful?" component renders and tests pass again. ([#10939](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10939))
- Removed in-page subsection entries from the documentation sidebar so the correct page is highlighted when selected; the right-hand table of contents continues to provide in-page navigation. ([#10903](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10903))
- Documentation feedback submissions now create tickets that remain in "Intake" status instead of moving to "To-do". ([#10933](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10933))
- Moved code examples out of parameter descriptions in the checkpoint action API reference, so email and Slack notification action docs render with correct formatting. ([#10918](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10918))
- Added documentation for AI-recommended Expectations. ([#10913](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10913))
- Fixed `*` being rendered as an escaped HTML entity in API reference code blocks. ([#10915](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10915))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Introduced a general set of metric result types covering the majority of commonly requested metrics. ([#10932](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10932))
- Removed documentation snippet files that were no longer referenced by any docs page. ([#10937](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10937))
- Added `Metric` and `Domain` base classes for defining and instantiating metrics, such as `ColumnValuesBetween` from `great_expectations.metrics`. ([#10920](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10920))
- Removed the concurrency block from the GitHub CI workflow that was causing jobs to be cancelled. ([#10930](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10930))
- Requesting a cloud context without the necessary environment variables now raises the intended, clear error instead of an opaque message; existing behavior for `cloud_mode` and explicit `mode` precedence is unchanged. ([#10916](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10916))

### 1.3.5 (2025-02-03)

#### Changes

##### Docs

- Fixed documentation site search behavior. ([#10907](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10907))
- Documentation admonitions (notes, tips, warnings) now display new icons. ([#10899](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10899))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Validation results produced by running a Validation Definition now consistently carry a run identifier. ([#10909](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10909))
- The Window type now accepts a `strict` setting so it can be used with dynamic-parameter Expectations. ([#10906](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10906))
- BigQuery test resources are now cleaned up every three hours. ([#10900](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10900))
- Expanded `row_condition` datetime test coverage for Pandas and Spark, added Spark support for `column_types` and Pandas/Spark I/O options in the Expectation testing framework, corrected handling of Spark partition filenames that contain but do not end in a file name, and documented how to run Spark tests locally. ([#10892](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10892))

</details>

### 1.3.4 (2025-01-29)

#### Highlights

- **Datetime `row_condition` values no longer truncated to dates** — A `row_condition` that filters on a datetime column now compares the full timestamp instead of being truncated to a date, so expectations validated against Postgres `timestamp` columns filter the rows you asked for. ([#10891](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10891))

- **Clearer API reference pages** — API reference pages now render method signatures as Python code blocks and class properties as tables, making them easier to scan. ([#10882](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10882), [#10880](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10880))

- **Migration guide available in the 0.18 docs** — The 0.18 documentation now includes the migration guide, so users still on 0.18 can find upgrade instructions without leaving the versioned docs. ([#10885](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10885))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed `row_condition` datetime values being truncated to dates against Postgres `timestamp` columns, and expanded date-type test coverage across backends. ([#10891](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10891))

##### Docs

- Removed incorrectly versioned 0.18 copies of the docs home page and integration support policy page, and hid the version dropdown on the Integration support policy and Get support pages. ([#10893](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10893))
- Documented dynamic parameters for completeness expectations in the expectation management docs. ([#10873](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10873))
- API reference pages now display method signatures as Python code blocks. ([#10882](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10882))
- API reference pages now display class properties as tables. ([#10880](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10880))

- Added the migration guide to the 0.18 documentation. ([#10885](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10885))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Simplified the permissions checker workflow so it fails when a user lacks permissions, without a separate bot check. ([#10895](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10895))
- Pull requests opened from forks can now run CI after a repository member retries the failed jobs. ([#10894](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10894))

</details>

### 1.3.3 (2025-01-22)

Compatibility: `databricks-sql-connector` removed (extra `databricks`); `databricks-sqlalchemy` added (extra `databricks`)

#### Highlights

- **Expectations with identical attributes can now coexist in a Suite** — Adding two Expectations of different types that happen to have identical attributes to the same Suite now works as expected — previously the second Expectation was silently not added. ([#10884](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10884))

  ```python
  suite.add_expectation(gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="passenger_count"))
  suite.add_expectation(gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique(column="passenger_count"))
  ```

- **Validation result descriptions are JSON-serializable** — `describe_dict()` on suite and expectation validation results now returns a plain, JSON-serializable dictionary, so the output of `describe()` can be passed straight to `json.dumps` without errors. ([#10863](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10863))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(suite)
  print(json.dumps(result.describe_dict()))
  ```

- **Databricks SQLAlchemy support via `databricks-sqlalchemy`** — Databricks connectivity now relies on the `databricks-sqlalchemy` package instead of `databricks-sql-connector`, which dropped SQLAlchemy support in its 4.0.0 release. Installing the `databricks` extra pulls in the new dependency. ([#10886](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10886))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Expectations of different types with identical attributes can now both be added to the same Suite. ([#10884](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10884))
- `describe_dict()` on suite and expectation validation results now returns a JSON-serializable dictionary, so `describe()` output can be passed to `json.dumps`. ([#10863](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10863))

##### Docs

- Corrected and clarified the documentation on choosing a result format. ([#10875](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10875))
- Updated the documentation about batch parameters and linked to the updated API docs. ([#10877](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10877))
- API Reference pages now show titles for the properties and methods sections. ([#10821](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10821))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Databricks support now uses the `databricks-sqlalchemy` package instead of `databricks-sql-connector`, which removed SQLAlchemy support in version 4.0.0. ([#10886](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10886))
- Reworked the batch test setup helpers so tests create their own assets instead of sharing one, avoiding duplicate batch definition names across tests. ([#10864](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10864))
- Added a method for setting the analytics user agent string. ([#10883](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10883))
- Analytics events and contexts now carry a user agent string, allowing callers such as GX operators to identify themselves. ([#10869](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10869))
- The S3 store backend now correctly handles objects returned with `aws-chunked` content encoding. ([#10861](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10861))

</details>

### 1.3.2 (2025-01-17)

#### Highlights

- **Strict bounds for table row count expectations** — `ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween` now accepts `strict_min` and `strict_max`, so you can require the row count to be strictly greater than the minimum and strictly less than the maximum. ([#10845](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10845))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  expectation = gxe.ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween(
      min_value=10,
      max_value=100,
      strict_min=True,
      strict_max=True,
  )
  ```

- **Add or update a Checkpoint in one call** — The Checkpoint factory now offers `add_or_update`, which creates a Checkpoint if it does not exist yet and replaces the stored configuration if it does. ([#10856](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10856))

  ```python
  checkpoint = context.checkpoints.add_or_update(checkpoint)
  ```

- **Faster feedback on invalid Expectation arguments** — Several Expectations now validate their input arguments when you create them, raising an error immediately instead of failing partway through validation. Multicolumn map Expectations also now require at least two entries in `column_list`. ([#10833](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10833), [#10850](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10850))

#### Changes

##### Features

- `ExpectTableRowCountToBeBetween` now supports the `strict_min` and `strict_max` parameters. ([#10845](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10845))
- Added `add_or_update` to the Checkpoint factory so a Checkpoint can be created or replaced in a single call. ([#10856](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10856))

##### Bug fixes

- Several Expectations now validate their input arguments up front and raise an error immediately rather than failing during validation. ([#10833](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10833))
- Expectations backed by pandas `Series.between()` now handle all combinations of inclusive bounds correctly across supported pandas versions. ([#10837](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10837))
- `ExpectColumnUniqueValueCountToBeBetween` now honors `strict_min` and `strict_max`, which were previously ignored. ([#10835](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10835))

##### Docs

- Updated a documentation screenshot to reflect the current handling of observed values in the validation run history view. ([#10867](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10867))
- Corrected the documented approach for defining a custom SQL Expectation in GX Cloud. ([#10844](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10844))
- Added explicit anchor IDs to repeated headings in the documentation so that direct links to a section now land on the intended section. ([#10846](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10846))
- Corrected typos and removed an outdated reference to suites in the GX Cloud UI from the data quality use case pages. ([#10847](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10847))
- Documented how to request the GX Agent from within the GX Cloud app on the agent deployment page. ([#10836](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10836))

- Consolidated the documentation about analytics and usage statistics into a single place. ([#10853](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10853))
- Corrected the capitalization of admonition titles throughout the documentation. ([#10813](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10813))
- Reorganized the Expectation selection documentation so Expectations are grouped by the data quality issue they address. ([#10806](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10806))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Multicolumn map Expectations now reject a `column_list` with fewer than two columns when the Expectation is created. ([#10850](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10850))
- Continuous integration now skips the slow quoted-identifier tests that were already expected to fail. ([#10857](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10857))
- Unpinned `snowflake-sqlalchemy`, excluding only the broken 1.7.0 release. ([#10838](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10838))
- Applied a temporary fix to get past a failing test schema cleanup step. ([#10860](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10860))
- Microsoft SQL Server tests now run against the version 18 ODBC driver, with connection strings updated and consolidated accordingly. ([#10868](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10868))
- Pinned `boto3` to avoid a behavior change in a newer release. ([#10862](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10862))

- The `invoke deps` development task now accepts a `--force-reinstall` flag and has clearer help text. ([#10834](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10834))

</details>

### 1.3.1 (2025-01-08)

Compatibility: `posthog` minimum 2.1.0 removed

#### Highlights

- **Suite parameters in the `mostly` field** — Column map expectations now accept a suite parameter for `mostly`, so the threshold can be supplied at validation time instead of being fixed when the expectation is defined. ([#10829](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10829))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  expectation = gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(
      column="passenger_count",
      mostly={"$PARAMETER": "my_mostly"},
  )
  result = batch.validate(expectation, expectation_parameters={"my_mostly": 0.9})
  ```

- **`add_or_update` for suites and validation definitions** — You can now add a suite or a validation definition if it does not exist, or update it in place if it does, in a single call. ([#10796](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10796), [#10818](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10818))

  ```python
  suite = context.suites.add_or_update(suite)
  validation_definition = context.validation_definitions.add_or_update(validation_definition)
  ```

- **Observed values render again for expectations with descriptions** — Validation results in Data Docs and GX Cloud now show the observed value for an expectation that has a description, instead of rendering the description in its place. ([#10826](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10826))

- **`datetime.time` values serialize to JSON** — Values of type `datetime.time` can now be serialized, and are written out as ISO-format strings rather than raising a serialization error. ([#10795](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10795))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Column map expectations accept a suite parameter for the `mostly` field, so the threshold can be provided at validation time. ([#10829](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10829))
- Added `context.suites.add_or_update`, which adds a suite or updates the existing one with the same name. ([#10796](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10796))

##### Bug fixes

- An expectation's description no longer replaces the observed value in rendered validation results. ([#10826](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10826))
- `datetime.time` values are now serialized to JSON as ISO-format strings instead of failing. ([#10795](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10795))

##### Docs

- Reworked the Learn data pipeline tutorial page to present it as a general guide to integrating GX into a data pipeline rather than an Airflow-specific tutorial. ([#10828](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10828))

</details>

### 1.3.0 (2024-12-19)

#### Highlights

- **Databricks column type expectations now evaluate correctly** — `ExpectColumnValuesToBeInType` and `ExpectColumnValuesToBeInTypeList` now translate Databricks column types correctly, so type checks against Databricks tables evaluate as expected instead of failing on unrecognized type names. ([#10791](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10791), [#10787](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10787))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  suite.add_expectation(
      gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeInTypeList(
          column="passenger_count", type_list=["BIGINT", "INT"]
      )
  )
  ```

- **`table.column_type` resolves correctly on Snowflake and Postgres** — Column type evaluation against Snowflake and Postgres now reports the correct type, so expectations that depend on column types produce accurate results on these backends. ([#10776](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10776), [#10793](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10793), [#10786](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10786))

- **`UnexpectedRowsExpectation` results render in Data Docs** — `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` now renders a readable summary in Data Docs, including an observed value that is reported as an integer count for consistency with other expectations. ([#10758](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10758), [#10779](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10779), [#10777](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10777))

- **Expectation descriptions display correctly in Data Docs** — Custom expectation descriptions now appear as proper table cells in Data Docs validation results rather than rendering as internal renderer keys, and descriptions supplied from GX Cloud are handled as well. ([#10789](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10789), [#10768](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10768))

- **Simpler imports for writing custom validation actions** — `CheckpointResult` and `ActionContext` can now be imported directly from the top-level checkpoint module, and the `ValidationAction` building blocks needed to write a custom action are documented as public API alongside a new guide. ([#10788](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10788), [#10752](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10752), [#10772](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10772))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.checkpoint import ActionContext, CheckpointResult
  ```

#### Deprecations

- `DataContext.add_or_update_datasource` is deprecated. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#10784](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10784))

- Reverted the continuous integration change that ran pull request workflows with elevated triggers and an actor permissions check; CI once again runs on standard pull request events, with credentialed jobs restricted to the main repository. ([#10773](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10773))
- Continuous integration workflows were changed to run on pull request targets with an actor permissions check so that CI can run on pull requests from forks; this change was reverted later in this release. ([#10467](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10467))

### 1.2.6 (2024-12-11)

#### Highlights

- **Define your own custom validation actions** — You can now define custom actions and use them in Great Expectations validation workflows. Custom action classes are picked up automatically and serialize and deserialize correctly alongside built-in actions. ([#10743](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10743))

  ```python
  from great_expectations.checkpoint.actions import ValidationAction


  class MyCustomAction(ValidationAction):
      type: str = "my_custom_action"

      def run(self, checkpoint_result, action_context=None):
          ...
  ```

- **Pattern-matching expectations no longer require optional SQL dependencies** — LikePattern expectations now run in environments where the MySQL, MsSQL, or PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy libraries are not installed, instead of failing on a faulty attribute check. ([#10745](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10745))

- **ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet now defaults to exact matching** — The exact_match parameter of ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet now defaults to True, matching the behavior described in the Expectation Gallery documentation. ([#10746](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10746))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  # exact_match now defaults to True
  expectation = gxe.ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet(column_set=["id", "name"])
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- You can now define your own custom validation actions; they are registered automatically and serialize and deserialize correctly. ([#10743](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10743))

##### Bug fixes

- Fetching metrics for multiple data assets in a single call no longer returns metrics from a previously cached asset; the batch is now checked against the incoming batch request. ([#10744](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10744))
- ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet now defaults exact_match to True, matching its documented behavior. ([#10746](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10746))
- LikePattern expectations now work in environments without the MySQL, MsSQL, or PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy libraries installed. ([#10745](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10745))

##### Docs

- Documented key-pair authentication for connecting to Snowflake. ([#10751](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10751))
- Updated the content of the documentation site banner. ([#10747](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10747))
- Refreshed the Row Condition guidance, with consistent punctuation and corrected indentation in the examples. ([#10736](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10736))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Loosened a BigQuery test assertion so it tolerates BigQuery's updated error message wording. ([#10750](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10750))
- Added an atomic diagnostic observed-value renderer for ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet that highlights unexpected and missing columns whether or not the Expectation passed. ([#10748](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10748))
- Test schemas are now created with a common prefix so they are easier to identify and clean up manually. ([#10742](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10742))
- The expectation testing framework now allows developers to override the randomly generated table name when using SQL data sources. ([#10724](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10724))
- Added integration test coverage for UnexpectedRowsExpectation, including JOIN queries against a second table and partitioned batches, across the supported SQL and Spark data sources. ([#10733](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10733))

</details>

### 1.2.5 (2024-12-04)

#### Highlights

- **Observed-value rendering for value-set Expectations** — Validation results for value-set Expectations — including expect_column_distinct_values_to_be_in_set, expect_column_distinct_values_to_contain_set, and expect_column_most_common_value_to_be_in_set — now render their observed values as atomic content, with each observed item marked as expected or unexpected so it is clear which values fell outside the configured set. ([#10718](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10718), [#10697](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10697))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(gxe.ExpectColumnDistinctValuesToBeInSet(column="species", value_set=["setosa", "virginica"]))
  rendered = result.render()
  ```

- **Observed-value renderer for expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list** — Validation results for expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list now include a rendered observed value, so the actual column list is displayed alongside the expected ordered list. ([#10683](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10683))

- **The \{batch} keyword works with partitioned batches across more backends** — UnexpectedRowsExpectation queries that reference the \{batch} keyword now resolve correctly when the batch comes from a partitioner, including queries that use JOIN clauses, where previously some SQL backends raised errors or produced invalid SQL. ([#10721](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10721))

  ```python
  gxe.UnexpectedRowsExpectation(unexpected_rows_query="SELECT * FROM {batch} WHERE passenger_count > 7")
  ```

- **Version check no longer fails on network errors** — Great Expectations now handles connection failures while checking for a newer released version instead of surfacing an error to the user, so the library keeps working when there is no network access. ([#10720](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10720))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Value-set Expectations now render their observed values as atomic content, marking each observed value as expected or unexpected relative to the configured value set. ([#10718](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10718))
- Validation results for expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list now render the observed column list. ([#10683](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10683))

##### Bug fixes

- UnexpectedRowsExpectation queries using the \{batch} keyword now resolve correctly for partitioned batches on more SQL backends, including queries containing JOIN clauses. ([#10721](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10721))
- Connection errors raised while checking for the latest released version of Great Expectations are now handled gracefully. ([#10720](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10720))

- Added documentation redirects and fixed existing redirects that pointed to a retired legacy docs site. ([#10692](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10692))
- Updated the "Connect GX Cloud to ..." pages to reflect the current workflow. ([#10689](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10689))
- Applied the non-versioned section styling consistently across the GX Cloud documentation section. ([#10694](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10694))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Added test coverage for Expectation behavior against PostgreSQL column types. ([#10727](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10727))
- Removed a log message from the datasource store that could include sensitive information. ([#10729](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10729))
- Added tests for the remaining Expectations that were not yet covered by the new test suite. ([#10715](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10715))
- Added tests that exercise Expectations against Snowflake column types. ([#10706](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10706))
- Added tests asserting that misconfigured Expectations fail with informative error messages. ([#10696](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10696))
- Added a new per-Expectation test suite structure with broader coverage of Expectation behavior. ([#10688](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10688))
- Added an observed-value renderer for expect_column_most_common_value_to_be_in_set and a render state on rendered content parameters so individual set items can be shown as expected or unexpected. ([#10697](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10697))
- Pinned snowflake-sqlalchemy to avoid a breaking change in that dependency. ([#10698](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10698))

</details>

### 1.2.4 (2024-11-20)

#### Highlights

- **Duplicate expectations are no longer added to a suite** — Adding an expectation that already exists in a suite no longer creates a duplicate entry: uniqueness checks now compare the expectation itself, ignoring its identifier and the volatile `notes` and `meta` fields. Suite docstrings also point to suite indexing when deleting an expectation. ([#10662](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10662))

  ```python
  for _ in range(10):
      suite.add_expectation(gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(column="passenger_count", min_value=0, max_value=6))

  print(len(suite.expectations))  # 1
  ```

- **Expectation conditions documentation refreshed** — The Expectation conditions documentation has been rewritten with clearer language and separate, runnable examples for pandas, Spark, and SQL in every case. ([#10661](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10661))

- **Passing a plain string as a condition parser** — Supplying a string where the `ConditionParser` enum was previously required no longer raises a type error. ([#10667](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10667))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(
      column="passenger_count",
      min_value=0,
      row_condition='col("pickup_datetime") > "2019-01-01"',
      condition_parser="great_expectations",
  )
  ```

#### Changes

##### Docs

- Added data quality documentation covering integrity. ([#10583](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10583))
- Incorporated several community documentation contributions from November 2024. ([#10681](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10681))

- Documented an architecture decision record explaining why meta fields are not used. ([#10672](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10672))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Adding an expectation that duplicates one already in a suite no longer produces a second entry, expectation equality ignores the `notes` and `meta` metadata fields, and the suite docstring now shows deleting expectations by suite index. ([#10662](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10662))
- Passing a string in place of the `ConditionParser` enum no longer raises a type error, and row condition coverage was added to the Expectation testing framework. ([#10667](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10667))

- Added Spark integration testing support to the Expectation test framework. ([#10670](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10670))
- Reduced the workload of a flaky timing test so it fails on its own assertion rather than the CI timeout. ([#10663](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10663))
- Standardized the atomic diagnostic observed-value renderer to use template strings and parameters like other atomic renderers, with better inference of the observed value's type. ([#10643](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10643))

### 1.2.3 (2024-11-14)

#### Highlights

- **Double-sided Z-score expectations render their threshold value** — Expectations using a double-sided Z-score now render the inverse threshold as its numeric value instead of showing the literal placeholder text "$inverse_threshold". ([#10648](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10648))

- **No more spurious warnings when masking config strings without SQLAlchemy** — Configuration strings are no longer masked, so users without SQLAlchemy support installed (for example, when using Azure Blob Storage) no longer see unnecessary warnings. ([#10625](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10625))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Configuration strings are no longer masked, removing warnings for users who do not have SQLAlchemy support installed (for example with Azure Blob Storage). ([#10625](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10625))
- Double-sided Z-score expectations now render the numeric inverse threshold instead of the literal string "$inverse_threshold". ([#10648](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10648))

##### Docs

</details>

### 1.2.2 (2024-11-07)

#### Highlights

- **Row conditions accept column names containing spaces** — Row conditions whose column names contain spaces are now parsed correctly instead of raising an exception. ([#10611](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10611))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(
      column="passenger_count",
      row_condition='col("pickup location")=="A"',
      condition_parser="great_expectations",
  )
  ```

- **Renderer parameters restored when using row_condition** — Expectation keyword arguments are once again included as renderer parameters, so rendered output for Expectations that use a row condition shows the full set of parameters. ([#10632](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10632))

- **Batch definitions validate the column type they partition on** — Adding a batch definition to a SQL data asset now checks that the named column is a valid date/datetime column and raises a clear error otherwise, instead of failing later at validation time. ([#10590](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10590))

  ```python
  asset.add_batch_definition_daily(name="daily", column="event_date")
  ```

- **Connection strings masked in configuration output** — The `conn_str` field used by Azure Blob Storage data sources is now masked when configuration is displayed or serialized, keeping credentials out of output. ([#10626](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10626))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Expectation tests run against SQL backends now infer column types from the test data. ([#10622](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10622))
- Adding a batch definition to a SQL data asset now validates that the specified column is a supported type and raises an error when it is not. ([#10590](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10590))

##### Bug fixes

- Expectation keyword arguments are again passed through as renderer parameters, restoring missing parameters when a row condition is used. ([#10632](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10632))
- The `conn_str` field used by Azure Blob Storage data sources is now masked in configuration output. ([#10626](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10626))
- Batch Expectations now correctly handle `date` values for minimum and maximum bounds. ([#10613](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10613))
- Row conditions now parse column names that contain spaces instead of raising an exception. ([#10611](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10611))

- Added MySQL coverage to the Expectation testing framework. ([#10633](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10633))
- Simplified the internal test framework with clearer table lookups and more immutable setup objects. ([#10631](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10631))
- Extra table names used by tests are now randomly generated, and keys in extra test data are labels for correlation rather than table names. ([#10630](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10630))
- Test setup and teardown are now reused across compatible test configurations, avoiding unneeded database setup work. ([#10619](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10619))
- Expectation JSON schemas are now verified against the Draft-7 meta-schema, with `multiple_of` corrected to `multipleOf` and a regression test added. ([#10627](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10627))

</details>

### 1.2.1 (2024-10-31)

#### Highlights

- **Microsoft Teams notifications work end to end** — The Microsoft Teams notification action is now functional and supported as a first-class Checkpoint action: notification cards render correctly, Data Docs links are reachable from the card (Teams does not support `file:///` links in buttons, so the results are shown in an expandable card instead), and configuration values such as the webhook can be supplied through config substitution the same way Slack and Email actions allow. ([#10593](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10593), [#10599](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10599), [#10606](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10606), [#10595](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10595))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx
  from great_expectations.checkpoint import MicrosoftTeamsNotificationAction

  context = gx.get_context()
  action = MicrosoftTeamsNotificationAction(
      name="teams_notification",
      teams_webhook="${MY_TEAMS_WEBHOOK}",
      notify_on="all",
  )
  ```

- **Accurate unexpected row counts for UnexpectedRowsExpectation** — `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` now reports the true number of unexpected rows in its `observed_value` even when the query returns more than 200 rows, instead of capping the reported count. ([#10604](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10604))

- **Email action supports config substitution** — `EmailAction` configuration values now resolve string substitutions (for example `${SMTP_PASSWORD}`), so credentials can be kept out of your configuration files. ([#10600](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10600), [#10602](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10602))

- **Expectation integration tests run against PostgreSQL and Snowflake** — The Expectation integration test framework can now exercise Expectations against PostgreSQL and Snowflake backends, broadening the backends covered by Expectation test suites. ([#10582](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10582), [#10586](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10586))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Expectations can now be tested against a Snowflake backend in the Expectation integration test framework. ([#10586](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10586))
- Expectations can now be tested against a PostgreSQL backend in the Expectation integration test framework. ([#10582](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10582))

##### Bug fixes

- `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` now reports the correct unexpected row count when the query returns more than 200 rows. ([#10604](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10604))
- Data Docs results are now accessible from Microsoft Teams notifications via an expandable card, since Teams does not support `file:///` links. ([#10599](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10599))
- `EmailAction` configuration values now support string substitution, so credentials can be referenced instead of inlined. ([#10600](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10600))
- `MicrosoftTeamsNotificationAction` now works with GX 1.x and sends a redesigned notification card. ([#10593](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10593))
- Two `ExpectationSuite` objects with the same Expectations in a different order now compare as equal, so suites no longer fail freshness checks because of ordering. ([#10562](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10562))
- Corrected the type hints for the `mostly` and `value_set` Expectation parameters so plain values such as `mostly=1` type-check cleanly while the generated schemas stay unchanged. ([#10571](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10571))
- Added a redirect so the deploy-gx-agent documentation URL resolves instead of 404ing. ([#10573](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10573))

##### Docs

</details>

### 1.2.0 (2024-10-24)

#### Highlights

- **The `great_expectations` row condition parser is no longer experimental** — Row conditions written with the `great_expectations` parser are now a supported, non-experimental way to filter the rows an Expectation evaluates, and the parser now understands `==` comparisons. Documentation has been updated to match. ([#10524](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10524))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(
      column="passenger_count",
      row_condition='col("vendor_id") == 1',
      condition_parser="great_expectations",
  )
  ```

- **Row conditions rejected on Expectations where they have no effect** — Expectations that operate on table structure rather than rows — `ExpectColumnToExist`, `ExpectTableColumnCountToBeBetween`, `ExpectTableColumnCountToEqual`, `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchOrderedList`, `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet`, and `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` — no longer accept a `row_condition`, so a condition can no longer be silently ignored. `condition_parser` is now expressed as an enum of the supported parsers. ([#10519](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10519))

- **Faster validation result rendering** — Rendering validation results and Data Docs is noticeably faster. ([#10530](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10530))

- **New Learn page for running GX in an Airflow data pipeline** — The Learn documentation now includes a page pointing to the end-to-end tutorial for using GX inside an Airflow data pipeline, alongside cleaned-up tutorial landing and table-of-contents pages. ([#10534](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10534))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed file path Batch Definitions so they are serialized correctly and round-trip as expected. ([#10543](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10543))
- Ensured file-backed domain objects are persisted in JSON files. ([#10523](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10523))
- Improved rendering performance of validation results. ([#10530](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10530))
- Removed `row_condition` from Expectations where it has no effect (`ExpectColumnToExist`, `ExpectTableColumnCountToBeBetween`, `ExpectTableColumnCountToEqual`, `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchOrderedList`, `ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet`, and `UnexpectedRowsExpectation`), introduced an enum for `condition_parser`, and dropped the special-cased `pandas` default parser for three Expectations. ([#10519](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10519))

##### Docs

- Added documentation redirects for docs subdomains. ([#10558](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10558))
- Added references to the community issues board in the Get Support and community resources docs, and removed mention of the GX-supported label from the contributing doc. ([#10548](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10548))
- Fixed broken documentation links so they point at their current URLs. ([#10541](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10541))
- Changed dynamically generated links in the 0.18 API reference from relative paths to root-based paths so they resolve correctly. ([#10507](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10507))
- Added the base `Datasource` class to the public API documentation. ([#10527](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10527))
- Added a Learn page linking to the GX-in-the-data-pipeline Airflow tutorial, plus tense and wording cleanup on the tutorial landing and table-of-contents pages. ([#10534](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10534))
- Updated the Data Docs site configuration page to reflect that GX 1.x only supports writing Data Docs sites to a local filesystem. ([#10536](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10536))
- Added redirects for retired documentation URLs so bookmarked and search-result links land on the corresponding versioned or closest-matching page instead of a 404. ([#10516](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10516))
- Fixed assorted typos in the documentation. ([#10521](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10521))
- Bumped the maximum supported Python version stated in the documentation. ([#10522](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10522))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Removed the experimental designation from the `great_expectations` row condition parser, added support for the `==` condition, and updated the related documentation. ([#10524](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10524))
- Cleaned up redundant try/except blocks flagged by the TRY203 lint rule. ([#10540](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10540))
- Added `DataAsset.get_batch_definition` to the public API documentation. ([#10533](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10533))
- Upgraded the project's ruff linter to 0.7.0 and updated the corresponding lint suppression codes. ([#10535](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10535))
- Updated static analysis tooling: ruff 0.6.8 to 0.6.9 and mypy 1.11.1 to 1.12. ([#10525](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10525))

</details>

### 1.1.3 (2024-10-15)

Compatibility: Python `<3.12,>=3.9` → `<3.13,>=3.9`; `snapshottest` removed (extra `test`) (`python_version < "3.12"`)

#### Highlights

- **Python 3.12 support** — Great Expectations now supports Python 3.12; the supported range is Python >=3.9,\<3.13. ([#10503](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10503))

- **Data Docs icons render again** — Icons in Data Docs now load correctly instead of failing to appear, after switching to a working icon source. ([#10511](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10511))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed missing icons in Data Docs by serving them from a working CDN source. ([#10511](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10511))

##### Docs

- Corrected an incorrect label in the migration guide. ([#10518](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10518))
- Documented object factories as part of the public API reference. ([#10513](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10513))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Ran the ClickHouse test suite under its own isolated CI marker, since it is not yet compatible with Python 3.12. ([#10512](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10512))
- Extended the pact contract test to cover all expectation suites. ([#10506](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10506))
- Corrected how the release-related GitHub Actions install the release tooling. ([#10509](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10509))

- Removed the `snapshottest` test dependency. ([#10498](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10498))

</details>

### 1.1.2 (2024-10-10)

#### Highlights

- **Turn analytics on or off per project from code** — Data Contexts now expose an `enable_analytics` method that explicitly records whether analytics are enabled in the project config. When the project config holds a value, it takes precedence over the analytics environment variable, so you can keep a global environment default and still override it for a specific project. ([#10385](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10385))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  context.enable_analytics(False)
  ```

- **Result format dicts are no longer mutated by the Validator** — Passing a result format dict into a Validator no longer modifies the dict you provided, so checkpoints are no longer incorrectly considered stale and their validations run as expected. ([#10496](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10496))

- **V0 to V1 migration guide** — The documentation now includes a guide for migrating a project from Great Expectations V0 to V1. ([#10477](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10477))

#### Deprecations

- `context.get_datasource` is deprecated; use `context.data_sources.get`. Removal in 2.0.0. ([#10471](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10471))

#### Changes

##### Features

- Added `context.enable_analytics` to explicitly enable or disable analytics for a project; a value stored in the project config now takes precedence over the analytics environment variable. ([#10385](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10385))

##### Bug fixes

- A result format dict passed to a Validator is no longer mutated, fixing checkpoint validations that failed because the checkpoint was treated as stale. ([#10496](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10496))

##### Docs

- Updated the minimum supported version shown in the documentation. ([#10494](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10494))
- Added a V0 to V1 migration guide to the documentation. ([#10477](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10477))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- `context.get_datasource` is deprecated in favor of `context.data_sources.get`; it now delegates to that method while keeping its existing error behavior. ([#10471](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10471))
- Removed the unused `result_url` attribute from `CheckpointResult`. ([#10493](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10493))

</details>

### 1.1.1 (2024-10-08)

Compatibility: Python `<3.12,>=3.8` → `<3.12,>=3.9`; `ipython` removed; `ipywidgets` removed; `makefun` removed; `numpy` removed (`python_version == "3.8"`); `pandas` removed (`python_version <= "3.8"`); `pytz` removed; `urllib3` removed; removed extra `test`

#### Highlights

- **Python 3.9 is now the minimum supported Python version** — Python 3.8 reached end of life, so GX Core no longer supports it. Supported versions are now Python 3.9 through 3.11, with experimental support for 3.12 and later available via the GX_PYTHON_EXPERIMENTAL environment variable. The README now states the updated support policy. ([#10441](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10441), [#10474](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10474))

- **Leaner install footprint** — Installing great_expectations now pulls in fewer third-party packages: the top-level urllib3, pytz, ipython, ipywidgets, and makefun requirements have been removed, and the requirements files were tidied up. ([#10488](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10488), [#10489](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10489), [#10487](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10487), [#10472](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10472), [#10485](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10485))

- **Slack webhook credentials no longer leak into serialized configuration** — SlackNotificationAction now substitutes configured credentials just in time when the action runs, so your token or webhook URL is no longer written out when the action is serialized. ([#10476](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10476))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx
  from great_expectations.checkpoint import SlackNotificationAction

  action = SlackNotificationAction(
      name="notify_slack",
      slack_webhook="${SLACK_WEBHOOK}",
  )
  print(action.json())  # the substituted secret is no longer included
  ```

- **Validation results from GX Cloud carry their backend-assigned IDs** — Validation results produced against a Cloud-backed Data Context now come back with the IDs generated by the Cloud backend, so you can reference and look them up reliably. ([#10478](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10478))

- **New tutorial for dbt, Airflow, and Postgres with GX** — The documentation now includes an end-to-end tutorial showing how dbt, GX, Airflow, and Postgres work together to validate data in a pipeline. ([#10458](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10458))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Validation results generated against a Cloud-backed Data Context now receive the IDs assigned by the Cloud backend. ([#10478](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10478))
- SlackNotificationAction credentials are no longer serialized: variable substitution now happens when the action runs rather than when it is constructed. ([#10476](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10476))

##### Docs

- Glossary term links in the 0.18 documentation now point at the versioned URLs instead of returning 404s. ([#10479](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10479))
- Added a tutorial demonstrating how dbt, GX, Airflow, and Postgres can be used together. ([#10458](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10458))
- The README integration support policy now states that GX Core supports Python 3.9 through 3.11, dropping the reference to Python 3.8. ([#10474](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10474))

<details>

</details>

### 1.1.0 (2024-10-03)

#### Highlights

- **Pass expectation parameters to `Batch.validate()`** — `Batch.validate()` now accepts expectation parameters, so you can supply runtime parameter values when validating a single expectation or an expectation suite against a batch. ([#10456](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10456))

  ```python
  batch.validate(expectation, expectation_parameters={"min_value": 1})
  ```

- **Better autocomplete for `context.data_sources`** — Additional method signatures are now published for `context.data_sources`, so editors and type checkers offer complete autocomplete and type information for data source methods. ([#10447](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10447))

  ```python
  context.data_sources.add_snowflake(name="my_ds", connection_string="...")
  ```

- **Environment variable substitution in Slack notifications** — `SlackNotificationAction` now supports `${VAR}` substitution, so Slack webhooks and tokens can be supplied through environment variables or config variables instead of being hard-coded. ([#10443](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10443))

  ```python
  SlackNotificationAction(name="slack", slack_webhook="${SLACK_WEBHOOK}")
  ```

#### Changes

##### Features

- `Batch.validate()` accepts expectation parameters, letting you pass runtime parameter values when validating against a batch. ([#10456](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10456))
- Autocomplete and type hints for `context.data_sources` now cover previously missing methods. ([#10447](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10447))

##### Bug fixes

- `SlackNotificationAction` now resolves `${VAR}`-style substitutions in its configuration values. ([#10443](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10443))
- Data Sources added, updated, or deleted at runtime are now reflected when you print the Data Context. ([#10438](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10438))
- Fixed an outdated link in the README that pointed to a page that has moved. ([#10446](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10446))

##### Docs

</details>

### 1.0.6 (2024-10-01)

#### Highlights

- **Clear error when opening Data Docs that haven't been built** — Calling `context.open_data_docs()` when no Data Docs have been built now raises a descriptive `NoDataDocsError` instead of failing opaquely. ([#10439](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10439))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  context = gx.get_context()
  context.open_data_docs()  # raises NoDataDocsError if no Data Docs exist
  ```

- **Expectation windows for dynamic parameters** — Expectations accept a new optional `windows` field that describes temporal window definitions, enabling dynamic parameters. When empty, the field is omitted from dict serialization and serialized as `null` in JSON. ([#10402](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10402))

  ```python
  import great_expectations.expectations as gxe

  expectation = gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="passenger_count", windows=None)
  ```

- **Suites render reliably when loaded** — Suites are now rendered when they are loaded, removing the runtime exceptions that came up when adding a validation definition for a freshly created suite or running checkpoints loaded from GX Cloud. ([#10434](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10434))

#### Changes

##### Features

- `open_data_docs()` now raises a descriptive `NoDataDocsError` when no Data Docs have been built. ([#10439](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10439))
- Expectations accept a new optional `windows` field for configuring temporal window definitions used by dynamic parameters. ([#10402](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10402))

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed runtime errors caused by unrendered suites: suites are now rendered when loaded, so adding a validation definition for a newly created suite and running checkpoints loaded from GX Cloud no longer fail. ([#10434](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10434))

##### Docs

- Added a data quality technical documentation page covering Volume. ([#10362](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10362))
- Improved the documentation search bar styling and added a hover border to the color mode toggle for visual consistency. ([#10436](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10436))
- Reverted the documentation search bar on desktop screens to the previous design after searches dropped with the minimalistic version. ([#10409](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10409))
- Fixed typos in the GX Cloud overview and deployment pattern documentation. ([#10429](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10429))
- Reorganized and updated the GX Cloud deployment and architecture pattern content into a single GX Cloud overview page. ([#10345](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10345))
- Excluded internal template pages from the documentation sitemap so they no longer appear in site search results. ([#10401](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10401))
- Updated the `UnexpectedRowsExpectation` documentation to clarify that subclassing is not required, that the `{batch}` keyword is optional, and to add a GX Cloud section on Custom SQL Expectations. ([#10391](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10391))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Expectation equality comparisons ignore rendered content, so otherwise-identical expectations compare as equal regardless of whether they have been rendered. ([#10444](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10444))
- Added test coverage for expectation parameters being passed through to checkpoints. ([#10435](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10435))
- Updated the ruff linter from 0.5.3 to 0.6.8, including formatting and linting of Jupyter notebook files. ([#10442](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10442))

</details>

### 1.0.5 (2024-09-19)

Compatibility: `databricks-sql-connector` added (extra `databricks`); removed extra `databricks`; new extra `spark-connect`

#### Highlights

- **Spark Connect DataFrames are now accepted** — You can now pass Spark Connect DataFrames to Great Expectations wherever a Spark DataFrame is expected; previously only classic Spark DataFrames were accepted and Spark Connect DataFrames were rejected. Note that sessions created through the Spark Connect session factory methods are still not supported. ([#10420](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10420))

- **Regex and LIKE Expectations work on Databricks SQL** — Expectations such as expect_column_values_to_match_regex and expect_column_values_to_match_like_pattern now run correctly against Databricks SQL. ([#10406](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10406))

  ```python
  batch.validate(
      gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToMatchRegex(column="name", regex=".*")
  )
  ```

- **`{batch}` keyword works in UnexpectedRowsExpectation queries** — Queries that use the `{batch}` keyword now run successfully on Postgres, which requires subquery aliases in SELECT and WHERE clauses, and on all backends when the batch uses a splitter, where batch parameters are now rendered as literal values. ([#10392](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10392))

  ```python
  gxe.UnexpectedRowsExpectation(
      unexpected_rows_query="SELECT * FROM {batch} WHERE passenger_count > 6"
  )
  ```

- **Documentation for connecting GX Cloud to Databricks SQL** — The GX Cloud documentation now includes a "Connect to Databricks SQL" page, listed in the documentation table of contents. ([#10394](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10394), [#10423](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10423))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Connecting to Databricks SQL no longer fails with an AttributeError when the installed `databricks` package does not provide a `sqlalchemy` sub-module, and the minimum supported `databricks-sql-connector` version has been raised. ([#10424](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10424))
- Spark Connect DataFrames are now accepted wherever Spark DataFrames are, instead of being rejected as an unsupported type; DataFrames from sessions created via the Spark Connect session factory methods remain unsupported. ([#10420](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10420))
- Regex- and LIKE-based Expectations, including expect_column_values_to_match_regex and expect_column_values_to_match_like_pattern, now work against Databricks SQL. ([#10406](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10406))
- Using the `{batch}` keyword in an unexpected-rows query no longer fails on Postgres due to missing subquery aliases, and no longer fails on any backend when the batch uses a splitter, since batch parameters are now rendered as literal values. ([#10392](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10392))

##### Docs

- The "Connect to Databricks SQL" page is now listed in the GX Cloud documentation table of contents. ([#10423](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10423))
- The published changelog now includes the 0.18.18 through 0.18.21 releases. ([#10422](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10422))
- Added a "Connect to Databricks SQL" page to the GX Cloud documentation. ([#10394](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10394))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- `FabricPowerBIDatasource` now lives outside the `great_expectations.experimental` sub-package, removing confusion with the separate contributor experimental package. ([#10419](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10419))
- Corrected the type annotations for `SQLAlchemyExecutionEngine.get_connection()` and updated column identifier tests to match fixes carried over from the 0.18.x branch. ([#10399](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10399))

</details>

### 1.0.4 (2024-09-16)

#### Highlights

- **Checkpoints with Slack and email actions run again** — Checkpoints configured with Slack or email notification actions no longer fail during setup; these actions now compare as equal when they are configured identically. ([#10393](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10393))

- **More reliable Data Docs links in checkpoint actions** — Checkpoint actions that reference Data Docs pages now retrieve those pages correctly in additional configurations, so notifications and updates include the expected Data Docs links. ([#10400](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10400))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Fixed additional cases where checkpoint actions failed to retrieve the correct Data Docs pages. ([#10400](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10400))
- Fixed action comparison so checkpoints using Slack or email notification actions can be run. ([#10393](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10393))

##### Docs

- Added "request a demo" calls to action to the GX Cloud sidebar, the resources dropdown, and the Why GX Cloud and Get Support pages. ([#10389](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10389))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Diagnostics for every nested validation definition are now emitted from the parent checkpoint run. ([#10386](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10386))

</details>

### 1.0.3 (2024-09-12)

Compatibility: `sqlalchemy` minimum set to 1.4.0 (extra `snowflake`)

#### Highlights

- **List available batches without loading data** — `BatchDefinition` now offers a public `get_batch_identifiers_list()` method that returns the batch identifiers available for that batch definition. It replaces the old `get_batch_list_from_batch_request` workflow for inspecting available batches, and because it does not read the underlying data it is considerably faster. ([#10383](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10383), [#10295](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10295))

  ```python
  batch_definition = asset.get_batch_definition("daily")
  for identifiers in batch_definition.get_batch_identifiers_list():
      print(identifiers)
  ```

- **Fetch a single batch with `get_batch`** — `get_batch_list_from_batch_request` has been replaced by `get_batch`, which retrieves only the batch you actually need instead of reading every matching batch. For Pandas filesystem datasources in particular, this removes the long-standing cost of loading data for batches that were never used. ([#10295](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10295))

  ```python
  batch = batch_definition.get_batch()
  result = batch.validate(expectation)
  ```

- **Checkpoint results no longer break Data Docs links in actions** — Checkpoint actions such as the Microsoft Teams notification no longer raise a `TypeError` when building Data Docs links from a checkpoint run; the links are rendered correctly again. ([#10374](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10374))

#### Changes

##### Features

- `BatchDefinition.get_batch_identifiers_list()` is now available as a public, non-data-reading way to see which batches a batch definition covers. ([#10383](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10383))
- Running a Checkpoint now emits usage analytics for the run. ([#10382](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10382))
- `get_batch_list_from_batch_request` is replaced by `get_batch`, which fetches only the batch you need, and by `get_batch_identifiers_list` for inspecting available batch metadata; documentation has been updated to the new methods. ([#10295](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10295))

##### Bug fixes

- Checkpoint actions no longer fail with `TypeError: list indices must be integers` when rendering Data Docs page links. ([#10374](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10374))

##### Docs

- The feedback survey is no longer shown on the documentation homepage. ([#10378](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10378))
- Data quality use case articles in the Learn section now use small text instead of superscript for footnotes. ([#10377](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10377))
- Documentation now lists BigQuery in the GX Core support posture. ([#10375](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10375))
- Documentation now describes the support posture for Data Docs. ([#10373](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10373))
- The GX Core introduction page now includes an embedded overview video. ([#10366](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10366))
- Changelog attributions for the 1.0 releases now credit external contributors. ([#10348](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10348))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Removed unused miscellaneous helper functions from the internal test utilities. ([#10357](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10357))
- Added test coverage for up-to-date (freshness) checks on validation definitions and checkpoints. ([#10381](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10381))
- Added test coverage for up-to-date (freshness) checks on batch definitions and expectation suites. ([#10380](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10380))
- Validation definitions and checkpoints are now checked for being up to date with their stored versions, raising a dedicated error when they are not. ([#10365](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10365))
- Rendering an expectation's description no longer risks a `KeyError` when configuration or result values are absent. ([#10353](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10353))
- Errors raised when a resource is not added or not up to date now live in a dedicated module with a clearer class hierarchy. ([#10359](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10359))
- Cleaned up test fixtures. ([#10358](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10358))
- Batch definitions and expectation suites are now checked for being up to date before they are saved. ([#10277](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10277))
- Removed error types left over from legacy versions to simplify the set of exceptions the library raises. ([#10356](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10356))
- An expectation's `description`, when set, is now always rendered in place of the default rendered text, and it is omitted from serialized expectation suites when unset. ([#10347](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10347))
- Expectation equality comparison now handles `meta` and `notes` more simply and consistently. ([#10349](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10349))
- Type checking now runs against SQLAlchemy 2, while both SQLAlchemy 1 and 2 remain supported at runtime. ([#10112](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10112))

</details>

### 1.0.2 (2024-09-05)

#### Highlights

- **Choose a result format when validating a Batch** — You can now pass a result format when validating a Batch or Expectation directly, so you control how much detail comes back without changing your suite or checkpoint configuration. ([#10281](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10281))

  ```python
  result = batch.validate(expectation, result_format="COMPLETE")
  ```

- **Value sets are no longer mangled into dictionaries** — Expectations that take a value set now keep lists of strings intact — a value set such as ["HI", "AK"] is no longer coerced into a dictionary like \{"H": "I", "A": "K"}. ([#10325](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10325))

  ```python
  gxe.ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet(column="state", value_set=["HI", "AK"])
  ```

- **Data Docs show the Data Asset name for fluent Data Sources** — Data Docs pages now display the Data Asset name for fluent Data Sources, making it clear which asset a set of Validation Results came from. ([#9953](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/9953))

- **Clearer UnexpectedRowsExpectation results and rendering** — UnexpectedRowsExpectation now renders its query as a code block, reports an observed value with contextual information instead of a bare row count, and treats the \{batch} keyword in unexpected_rows_query as optional while telling you when it is missing. ([#10334](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10334), [#10311](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10311))

  ```python
  gxe.UnexpectedRowsExpectation(
      unexpected_rows_query="SELECT * FROM {batch} WHERE passenger_count > 6"
  )
  ```

- **Light and dark theme selector in the documentation site** — The documentation site now offers a theme selector so you can read the docs in light or dark mode. ([#10181](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10181))

#### Changes

##### Features

- You can now set the result format when validating a Batch, and a single result-format type and default constant are available for reuse. ([#10281](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10281))

##### Bug fixes

- Data Docs now show the Data Asset name for fluent Data Sources. ([#9953](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/9953))
- Slack and email notifications no longer fail when rendering Validation Results that have no active batch definition. ([#10344](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10344))
- Validation Results no longer carry the queried dataframe in their result payload. ([#10338](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10338))
- Value sets passed to Expectations are no longer coerced into dictionaries, so lists such as ["HI", "AK"] are preserved as given. ([#10325](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10325))
- Requesting a Batch from a Fabric Power BI Data Source no longer raises a TypeError about an unexpected 'options' keyword argument. ([#10318](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10318))

##### Docs

- GX Cloud alerting documentation now covers email alerts instead of Slack alerts. ([#10320](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10320))
- Superscript footnote markers in the application integration support tables now render consistently. ([#10337](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10337))

- The Airflow tutorial now works with both GX 0.18.x and GX Core 1.0. ([#10319](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10319))
- Data Context descriptions now include general use cases for each type of Data Context. ([#10292](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10292))
- The create a Validation Definition guide now lists a Batch Definition, rather than a Data Asset, as its prerequisite. ([#10288](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10288))
- Documentation now correctly describes printed Validation Results as JSON rather than YAML. ([#10287](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10287))

- Updated the project README. ([#10294](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10294))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- UnexpectedRowsExpectation renders its query as a code block, reports a descriptive observed value instead of a row count, and accepts an unexpected_rows_query without the \{batch} keyword while warning when it is missing. ([#10334](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10334))
- UnexpectedRowsExpectation carries metadata and a docstring consistent with core Expectations, and its description is now an instance attribute. ([#10311](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10311))

</details>

#### Contributors

Thanks to @masfworld (first contribution).

### 1.0.1 (2024-08-29)

#### Highlights

- **Checkpoints now hold onto the exact Validation Definition you pass in** — A Checkpoint now references the same `ValidationDefinition` instance it was given, so changes you make to that object are reflected when the Checkpoint runs instead of acting on a separate copy. ([#10274](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10274))

  ```python
  validation_definition = context.validation_definitions.add(
      gx.ValidationDefinition(name="my_vd", data=batch_definition, suite=suite)
  )
  checkpoint = gx.Checkpoint(name="my_checkpoint", validation_definitions=[validation_definition])
  assert checkpoint.validation_definitions[0] is validation_definition
  ```

- **Validation Definition API reference documentation** — `ValidationDefinition` and its methods are now marked as public API, so they appear in the published API reference documentation. ([#10282](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10282))

- **Docs now show a tested way to check your installed GX Core version** — The documentation's instructions for verifying which version of GX Core is installed have been updated and the example is now covered by tests. ([#10286](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10286))

  ```python
  import great_expectations as gx

  print(gx.__version__)
  ```

- **Direct links to full code examples in the GX Core docs** — Every procedure and sample-code tab group in the GX Core docs now has a header and a query string, so you can link straight to the full code example for any given procedure. ([#10258](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10258))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- A Checkpoint now references the same Validation Definition instance that was passed to it rather than a copy, so later edits to that object take effect when the Checkpoint runs. ([#10274](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10274))

##### Docs

- Removed orphaned documentation pages and leftover content from the previous documentation structure, and updated links that pointed to them. ([#10260](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10260))
- Updated the documented method for checking the version of the installed GX Core library and put the example under test. ([#10286](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10286))
- Updated the support and contribution documentation to match the current support posture, clarifying issue prioritization, pointing community discussion to Discourse, and documenting the issue labels. ([#10298](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10298))
- Removed the examples directory from the repository. ([#10293](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10293))
- Corrected a typo in the result format documentation, which referred to `results_url` instead of `result_url` when retrieving a GX Cloud result link. ([#10283](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10283))
- Updated the instructions for adding data assets to reflect the current workflow. ([#10200](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10200))
- Corrected the Databricks SQL docstring, which incorrectly referred to Postgres. ([#10148](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10148))
- Removed Redshift from the community-supported integrations listed in the application integration support documentation. ([#10280](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10280))
- Removed the misleading `/database` path element from Databricks SQL connection strings in the documentation and test examples, since it is ignored by the connector. ([#10273](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10273))
- Docstrings and some error messages now refer to Expectations by their class names instead of the older validator method names. ([#10268](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10268))
- Fixed the code block shown in the review Validation Results step of the guide to testing an Expectation. ([#10267](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10267))
- Replaced references to "GX OSS" and "GX 1.0" throughout the documentation with the current product name, GX Core. ([#10255](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10255))
- Added headers and query strings to the procedure and sample-code tab groups in the GX Core docs so full code examples can be linked to directly. ([#10258](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10258))
- Fixed a broken internal link to the available Expectations table in the GX Cloud documentation for v1.0 and v0.18. ([#10247](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10247))
- Promoted the 1.0 documentation to be the latest published version. ([#10261](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10261))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Simplified `ValidationDefinition` construction by removing a custom initializer override; behavior is unchanged. ([#10278](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10278))
- Upgraded the type checker to mypy 1.11.2 and resolved the new typing errors it surfaced; no runtime behavior changed. ([#10142](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10142))
- Checkpoint creation analytics events now include the ids of the associated validation definitions. ([#10290](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10290))
- Analytics events are no longer emitted from Azure CI runs. ([#10291](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10291))
- Marked `ValidationDefinition` as public API so it is included in the published API reference documentation. ([#10282](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10282))
- Analytics events are no longer emitted from CI runs. ([#10263](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10263))
- Loosened the `ruamel` version pin to allow 0.18 or greater, which resolves CVE-2019-20478. ([#10266](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10266))

</details>

### 1.0.0 (2024-08-22)

#### Highlights

- **Rendered content stays up to date** — Rendered content is now regenerated every time rather than reused from a previous render, so descriptions and rendered output always reflect the current expectations and validation results. ([#10257](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10257))

#### Changes

##### Bug fixes

- Content is now always re-rendered, so rendered output reflects the latest state instead of stale previously rendered content. ([#10257](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10257))
- Error messages raised when running a Checkpoint include the diagnostics for all of its child validation definitions, not just the first problem found. This change was subsequently reverted in this release. ([#10250](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10250))

##### Docs

- Updated the project README to describe GX Core. ([#10252](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10252))

<details>
<summary>Maintenance</summary>

- Reverted the previous change to Checkpoint and Validation Definition error reporting, restoring the earlier behavior where running an unsaved Checkpoint or Validation Definition is saved automatically when its children are already saved and otherwise raises the prior error message. ([#10256](https://github.com/fivetran/great_expectations/pull/10256))
