1. Run `java -version` to check if you have java installed. If no java is installed you can download it here: [https://www.java.com/en/download/](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
2. Run `docker compose up -d` in this directory to start the spark container

You should now be able to run the tests via `pytest --spark`
